- **express-validator:** Input validation
- **helmet:** Security headers
- **cors:** Cross-origin resource sharing
- **morgan:** HTTP request logging
- **socket.io:** WebSocket implementation
- **passport.js:** Authentication middleware (optional)

### 2.3 Database: PostgreSQL

**Justification:**
- **Relational Integrity:** Tennis match data has clear relationships (matches → sets → games → points)
- **ACID Compliance:** Ensures data consistency for score updates
- **JSONB Support:** Can store flexible metadata while maintaining relational structure
- **Advanced Querying:** Complex queries for filtering and searching matches
- **Scalability:** Handles growth from dozens to thousands of matches
- **Industry Standard:** Well-documented, widely supported, hosted options available

**Schema Design Considerations:**
```
users
├─ id (PK)
├─ email (unique)
├─ password_hash
├─ role (coach, viewer)
├─ created_at
└─ updated_at

matches
├─ id (PK)
├─ created_by (FK → users)
├─ player1_name
├─ player2_name
├─ player3_name (doubles, nullable)
├─ player4_name (doubles, nullable)
├─ match_type (singles, doubles)
├─ format (best_of_3, best_of_5)
├─ status (scheduled, in_progress, completed)
├─ winner_id (nullable)
├─ location
├─ scheduled_at
├─ started_at
├─ completed_at
├─ metadata (JSONB)
├─ created_at
└─ updated_at

sets
├─ id (PK)
├─ match_id (FK → matches)
├─ set_number
├─ player1_games
├─ player2_games
├─ tiebreak_score (JSONB, nullable)
├─ winner (1 or 2)
└─ completed_at

games
├─ id (PK)
├─ set_id (FK → sets)
├─ game_number
├─ server (1 or 2)
├─ player1_points
├─ player2_points
├─ winner (1 or 2)
└─ completed_at

points
├─ id (PK)
├─ game_id (FK → games)
├─ point_number
├─ winner (1 or 2)
├─ score_after (e.g., "15-0", "30-15")
└─ timestamp
```

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **MongoDB:** Better for unstructured data but tennis scoring has clear relational structure; lacks ACID guarantees needed for score integrity; less optimal for complex queries
- **SQLite:** Excellent for prototyping but limited concurrency support; not suitable for production web applications with multiple concurrent users; lacks advanced features

### 2.4 Authentication: JWT with Refresh Tokens

**Justification:**
- **Stateless:** Scalable across multiple servers without session storage
- **Cross-Platform:** Works seamlessly with mobile apps if expanded later
- **Performance:** No database lookup required for token validation
- **Security:** Short-lived access tokens (15 minutes) with longer refresh tokens (7 days)
- **Logout Capability:** Token blacklist for critical logout scenarios

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Access Token: Short-lived (15 minutes), contains user ID and role
2. Refresh Token: Longer-lived (7 days), stored in httpOnly cookie
3. Token Rotation: New refresh token issued with each refresh
4. Token Blacklist: Redis cache for revoked tokens (optional, for enhanced security)

**Security Best Practices (2025):**
- Store tokens in httpOnly, secure, sameSite cookies
- Implement CSRF protection
- Validate all token claims (iss, aud, exp)
- Use strong signing algorithms (HS256 or RS256)
- Implement rate limiting on auth endpoints
- Add MFA for enhanced security (optional)

**Alternative Considered:**
- **Session-Based Auth:** Better for same-domain applications with need for instant revocation; requires session storage (Redis); more complex for API-first architectures; our JWT approach with refresh tokens provides better scalability while maintaining security

### 2.5 Real-Time Updates: WebSockets (Socket.io)

**Justification:**
- **Bidirectional Communication:** Persistent connection enables instant score updates
- **Lower Latency:** <500ms updates vs. polling intervals of 3-5 seconds
- **Reduced Server Load:** Single connection vs. repeated HTTP requests
- **Better UX:** Truly real-time experience for viewers watching live matches
- **Socket.io Features:** Automatic reconnection, room-based broadcasting, fallback to polling

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. WebSocket connection established when viewing live match
2. Coaches emit score updates when recording points
3. Server broadcasts to all clients in match "room"
4. Automatic reconnection handles network interruptions
5. Fallback to HTTP polling if WebSocket unavailable

**Alternative Considered:**
- **Server-Sent Events (SSE):** One-way communication (server → client); simpler than WebSockets; good for dashboards but less flexible
- **HTTP Polling:** Simplest implementation; higher latency (3-5s minimum); increased server load; not suitable for real-time sports scoring

### 2.6 Additional Technologies

**State Management (Frontend):**
- **React Context + Hooks:** Sufficient for this application's complexity
- **Alternative:** Zustand for more complex state (if needed)

**Form Handling:**
- **React Hook Form:** Performant, minimal re-renders
- **Zod:** Runtime type validation

**Styling:**
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first, responsive design, excellent mobile support
- **shadcn/ui:** Pre-built accessible components

**Testing:**
- **Frontend:** Vitest (faster than Jest for Vite/Next.js), React Testing Library
- **Backend:** Jest, Supertest for API testing
- **E2E:** Playwright or Cypress

**DevOps:**
- **Version Control:** Git + GitHub
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
- **Monitoring:** Vercel Analytics (frontend), Sentry (error tracking)
- **Logging:** Winston (backend)

  {
    "success": true,
    "data": { ... },
    "message": "Success message"
  }
  ```
- Error responses:
  ```json
  {
    "success": false,
    "error": {
      "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",

CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_role ON users(role);

-- Matches table
CREATE INDEX idx_matches_status ON matches(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_matches_created_by ON matches(created_by);
CREATE INDEX idx_matches_scheduled_at ON matches(scheduled_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_matches_created_at ON matches(created_at);

-- Composite indexes for common queries
CREATE INDEX idx_matches_status_date ON matches(status, scheduled_at);
```

**Data Integrity:**
- Foreign key constraints for referential integrity
- Unique constraints on email addresses
- NOT NULL constraints on required fields
- Check constraints for valid enum values
- Cascading deletes for related records

**Migrations:**
- Use migration tool (node-pg-migrate or TypeORM)
- Version control all schema changes
- Test migrations in development before production
- Always include rollback scripts

### 3.4 Security Architecture

**Layers of Security:**

1. **Transport Security:**
   - HTTPS/TLS for all communications
   - Secure WebSocket (WSS)
   - HSTS headers

2. **Authentication Security:**
   - Bcrypt password hashing (12 rounds minimum)
   - JWT with secure signing algorithm (HS256/RS256)
   - httpOnly, secure, sameSite cookies
   - CSRF tokens for state-changing operations

3. **Authorization Security:**
   - Role-based middleware for route protection
   - Resource-level permissions (users can only edit their own matches)
   - Input validation on all endpoints

4. **Application Security:**
   - Helmet.js for security headers
   - Rate limiting (express-rate-limit)
   - Input sanitization to prevent XSS
   - Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
   - CORS with whitelist

5. **Infrastructure Security:**
   - Environment variables for secrets
   - No sensitive data in version control
