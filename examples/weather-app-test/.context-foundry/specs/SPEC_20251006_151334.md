## Goal
Build a simple web-based weather app that fetches current weather and a 5-day forecast from the OpenWeatherMap API.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to search for a city's weather so that I can know the current temperature and conditions in that city.
- As a user, I want to see a 5-day weather forecast for the city so that I can plan my activities accordingly.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] The app allows users to input a city name and fetch the current weather information.
- [ ] The app displays the current temperature, conditions, and a 5-day weather forecast for the entered city.

## Technical Requirements
- The app must use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- The app integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data.
- A `config.js` file should allow users to store their API key securely.

## Out of Scope
- The app will not include user authentication or persistent data storage.
- The app will not support multiple languages or localization features.
