# Implementation Plan: weather-app-test
Generated: 2025-10-06 15:14:35 UTC
Context Usage: 100%

## Approach
The application will use a modular approach with separate files for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. API calls to OpenWeatherMap will be made using the fetch API, and data will be rendered dynamically in the DOM.

## Architecture Decisions
| Decision                  | Options Considered             | Choice          | Rationale                                                 |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Client-Side Framework    | Vanilla JS, React, Vue        | Vanilla JS       | Simplicity for a basic weather app without performance overhead of frameworks |
| API Fetching Technique    | Fetch API, XMLHttpRequest     | Fetch API        | Simplifies the syntax for handling asynchronous requests and responses |
| Error Handling Strategy   | Alerts, UI Notifications      | UI Notifications  | Provides a better user experience directly within the app layout, rather than disrupting with alerts |

## Implementation Phases
1. **Phase 1**: Create the project structure with HTML layout, CSS styling, and JavaScript files.
2. **Phase 2**: Implement the logic to fetch data from the OpenWeatherMap API and handle user input.
3. **Phase 3**: Develop the UI display for current weather and 5-day forecast, including error handling and UI updates.

## Testing Strategy
- Manual testing by entering various city names and verifying the correctness of displayed weather data.
- Testing different scenarios including valid and invalid API keys, as well as misuse of the API (e.g., rate limits and incorrect city names).
- Assess user experience regarding error notifications and loading states.
  
## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk                               | Probability | Impact  | Mitigation                                                                       |
|------------------------------------|-------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CORS issues when testing locally    | Medium      | High    | Test hosted version or use a local server setup to avoid CORS errors.           |
| Rate limiting from OpenWeatherMap   | Medium      | Medium  | Implement debounce for user input and display informative messages on limits.    |
| Security risk of exposing API Key   | Medium      | High    | Use a backend server in production to make requests instead of exposing the key.  |
