# Implementation Plan: weather-app
Generated: 2025-10-05 21:40:00 UTC
Context Usage: 80%

## Approach
The implementation will leverage React for building the user interface and Axios for API calls to OpenWeatherMap. The project will be set up using create-react-app for rapid development, with Redux for managing application state.

## Architecture Decisions
| Decision                  | Options Considered          | Choice           | Rationale                                                                 |
|--------------------------|----------------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Frontend Framework        | React, Vue.js, Angular     | React            | Chosen for its component-based architecture and ecosystem for state management. |
| State Management          | Redux, Context API, MobX   | Redux            | Preferred for larger applications needing predictable state management.  |
| Styling                   | CSS, Sass, Tailwind        | Tailwind         | Provides utility-first styling that can rapidly improve UI design.      |

## Implementation Phases
1. **Phase 1**: Set up the project using create-react-app, install required dependencies (React, Axios, Redux, Tailwind), and initialize the basic file structure.
2. **Phase 2**: Develop components for input, display, and API handling, implement state management, and create responsive styling.
3. **Phase 3**: Conduct testing for components, integration, and application functionality while ensuring API interaction works as intended.
4. **Phase 4**: Deploy the application to a web hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel) and monitor for any issues.

## Testing Strategy
Testing will be conducted using Jest and React Testing Library. Unit tests will cover component rendering, API interactions, and error handling logic to ensure robustness against edge cases.

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk                       | Probability | Impact | Mitigation                                                          |
|---------------------------|-------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Exceeding API request limits | Medium      | High   | Implement a request limit in the frontend and caching mechanism.   |
| UI responsiveness issues    | Low         | Medium | Conduct thorough testing across devices during development.        |
| Errors in handling API responses | Medium      | High   | Implement comprehensive error handling and user feedback mechanisms. |
