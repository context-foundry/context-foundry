# Implementation Plan: weather-app

## Approach
Develop a single-page application using React for the front-end, Axios to handle API requests, and Bootstrap for styling the UI components. The application will manage state with Redux to maintain the weather data effectively.

## Architecture Decisions
| Decision               | Options Considered            | Choice          | Rationale                                                             |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Frontend Framework     | React, Vue.js                 | React            | Higher community support and familiarity within the team.            |
| State Management       | Redux, Vuex                   | Redux            | Offers a predictable state container for complex state management.  |
| HTTP Client            | Axios, Fetch API              | Axios            | Simplifies making requests and handling errors.                     |
| Styling Framework      | Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS       | Bootstrap        | Easy to implement and widely used for quick layout and components.  |

## Implementation Phases
1. **Phase 1**: Set up the project structure, install dependencies, and create static components (input field, button, and weather display).
2. **Phase 2**: Implement API call functionality, manage state with Redux to store weather data, and display it on the UI. Handle API error and success responses.
3. **Phase 3**: Enhance UI components for responsiveness and aesthetic appeal using Bootstrap. Optimize performance and implement caching for API responses.

## Testing Strategy
Utilize unit tests for individual components, integration tests for the API service, and end-to-end tests to validate user interactions with the UI. Ensure cross-browser compatibility.

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk                          | Probability | Impact | Mitigation                                |
|-------------------------------|-------------|--------|-------------------------------------------|
| API Rate Limiting             | Medium      | High   | Implement caching to avoid repeated requests. |
| CORS Issues                   | High        | Medium | Use a proxy for development and setup CORS headers correctly in production. |
| Mismanagement of API Responses | Medium      | High   | Thoroughly document and validate API response structures. |
