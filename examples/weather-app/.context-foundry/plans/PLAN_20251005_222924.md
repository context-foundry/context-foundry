# Implementation Plan: weather-app
Generated: 2023-10-05 22:29:35 UTC
Context Usage: 100%

## Approach
Develop a single-page application (SPA) using React for the frontend, utilizing Axios to interact with the OpenWeatherMap API. Use Tailwind CSS for styling to ensure a modern and responsive design.

## Architecture Decisions
| Decision                | Options Considered             | Choice         | Rationale                                                     |
|------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Frontend Framework      | React, Vue.js, Angular         | React          | Chosen for its component architecture and large ecosystem.   |
| State Management        | Local state, Redux, Context API| Context API    | Simpler for this app; sufficient for managing state.        |
| CSS Framework           | Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, Bulma | Tailwind CSS   | Allows for quick styling with utility-first approach.       |

## Implementation Phases
1. **Phase 1**: Set up the project structure with React, configure Tailwind CSS, and create basic components for City Search and Weather Display.
2. **Phase 2**: Implement API integration to fetch weather data based on user input and display results or error messages accordingly.

## Testing Strategy
Testing will be done through:
- Manual testing to ensure all features work as intended.
- Use Jest and React Testing Library for unit tests on components.
- Integration tests for API calls to verify proper handling of valid and invalid responses.

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk                          | Probability | Impact | Mitigation                                         |
|-------------------------------|-------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Exceeding API rate limits     | Medium      | High   | Implement caching for API responses.              |
| Invalid user input handling    | Low         | Medium | Introduce validation and error messaging.         |
| CORS issues when fetching data | Medium      | Medium | Configure the server or use proxy for API calls.  |
