# Implementation Plan: weather-app
Generated: 2025-10-05 21:54:50 UTC
Context Usage: 95%

## Approach
The weather app will be built as a single-page application using React. It will fetch current weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API using Axios for HTTP requests and maintain application state using the Context API. The layout will be responsive, leveraging CSS Flexbox/Grid to ensure compatibility across devices.

## Architecture Decisions
| Decision               | Options Considered           | Choice            | Rationale                                          |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Frontend Framework     | React, Vue, Angular         | React             | Simplicity, community support, and ease of learning.|
| State Management       | React Context API, Redux    | React Context API  | Sufficient for the app's current complexity.      |
| Styling Approach       | CSS Modules, Styled Components| CSS Modules        | Familiarity and ease of integration with React.   |

## Implementation Phases
1. **Phase 1**: Set up the basic application structure using create-react-app, incorporating key dependencies such as Axios for API calls.
2. **Phase 2**: Create components for searching weather, displaying data, and handling user input. Integrate weather data service to fetch data from OpenWeatherMap.
3. **Phase 3**: Implement error handling, localization for error messages, and refine the responsive design.
4. **Phase 4**: Conduct testing and optimization for performance and usability.

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for components and service functions.
- Integration testing for API calls and state management behavior.
- Manual testing to check for responsiveness and usability across devices.
