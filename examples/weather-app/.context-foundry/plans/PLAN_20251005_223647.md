# Implementation Plan: weather-app
Generated: 2025-10-05 22:45:00 UTC
Context Usage: 100%

## Approach
The implementation will follow a client-server architecture using React.js on the frontend for an SPA experience and Node.js with Express for the backend to handle communication with the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Architecture Decisions
| Decision           | Options Considered           | Choice       | Rationale                                                  |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Frontend Framework  | React, Vue.js, Angular      | React        | React's component-based architecture is suitable for SPA. |
| Backend Framework   | Express, Koa, Hapi          | Express      | Express offers a minimal and flexible framework.          |
| State Management    | Context API, Redux          | Context API  | Suitable for the scale of the application.                |
| Styling Methodology | CSS, SASS, styled-components | CSS          | Simple and effective for the initial implementation.      |

## Implementation Phases
1. **Phase 1**: Set up the project structure for both frontend and backend, including dependencies installation and basic routing.
2. **Phase 2**: Implement the weather fetching logic in the backend and connect the frontend to the backend API.
3. **Phase 3**: Develop user interface components for displaying weather data, including error handling and loading states.
4. **Phase 4**: Conduct testing and optimizations, followed by user feedback and final adjustments.

## Testing Strategy
We will use Jest for frontend components and Mocha/Chai for backend API testing. User testing sessions will also be scheduled for usability feedback.

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk                         | Probability | Impact       | Mitigation                                                   |
|------------------------------|-------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Rate limiting from API       | Medium      | Medium       | Implement caching mechanisms for repeated requests.         |
| API down time                | Low         | High         | Design for graceful degradation with fallback messages.     |
| State management complexity    | Medium      | Medium       | Use Context API efficiently; refactor as necessary.         |
