# Implementation Plan: weather-app

## Approach
The app will be developed as a single-page application (SPA) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We will use the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data asynchronously through `fetch()` calls. The app will follow the MVC architecture to keep the project organized and maintainable.

## Architecture Decisions
| Decision | Options Considered              | Choice     | Rationale                                          |
|----------|---------------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Frontend | Vanilla JS vs. Frameworks (React, Vue) | Vanilla JS | Simplicity for initial development and low overhead. |
| Styling  | CSS, CSS Frameworks (Bootstrap) | CSS        | Focus on custom styling for a unique design.      |
| API     | OpenWeatherMap API                | OpenWeatherMap | Free tier and global coverage.                     |

## Implementation Phases
1. **Phase 1**: Set up the project structure (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and create basic UI components.
2. **Phase 2**: Implement API calls to fetch weather data based on user input, and display that data.
3. **Phase 3**: Add error handling for invalid inputs and enhance user feedback.
4. **Phase 4**: Conduct cross-browser testing and make the app responsive using CSS techniques.

## Testing Strategy
Testing will consist of:
- Unit tests for JavaScript functions handling API requests and data processing.
- Manual testing for user interface components and responsiveness across devices.

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk                                | Probability | Impact | Mitigation                             |
|-------------------------------------|-------------|--------|---------------------------------------|
| API Rate Limiting                   | Medium      | High   | Monitor API usage and optimize calls. |
| CORS issues with API requests       | Medium      | Medium | Ensure proper handling and error messages. |
| Invalid user inputs                  | Low         | Medium | Implement robust input validation.     |
