# Implementation Plan: weather-app
Generated: 2025-10-05 21:35:00 UTC
Context Usage: 100%

## Approach
The implementation will utilize React for the frontend, with components managing UI states and interactions. The application will communicate with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data using Axios for HTTP requests. Responses will be managed efficiently to update the UI based on user inputs without full page reloads.

## Architecture Decisions
| Decision                         | Options Considered     | Choice      | Rationale                                         |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Framework                        | React, Vue, Angular    | React       | React's component-based model fits well for UI.   |
| State Management                 | Context API, Redux     | Context API | Simplicity for smaller app with fewer states.      |
| Styling Approach                 | CSS, Styled-Components | Styled-Components | Simplifies styling and promotes component encapsulation. |

## Implementation Phases
1. **Phase 1**: Set up the React development environment and create basic structure of components (Search, WeatherCard, Forecast).
2. **Phase 2**: Implement API integration using Axios to fetch current weather data and 5-day forecasts.
3. **Phase 3**: Design the UI with responsive styling and ensure all components are functioning as required.
4. **Phase 4**: Implement error handling and testing to ensure robustness and user-friendly experience.

## Testing Strategy
Unit testing will be performed for individual components using Jest and React Testing Library. API integration will be tested using mock data to simulate API responses. End-to-end testing can also be considered to validate overall functionality.

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk                               | Probability | Impact  | Mitigation                                       |
|------------------------------------|-------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------|
| API Rate Limiting                  | Medium      | High    | Implement caching strategies and handle errors gracefully. |
| CORS Issues                         | Low         | Medium  | Use local development proxies to bypass CORS.   |
| Variation in Weather Data Format    | Medium      | High    | Create adaptable component structures that handle different data formats. |
