## Goal
Build a beautiful, web-based weather app that allows users to view current weather conditions and forecasts for a specific city using the OpenWeatherMap API.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to search for weather information by city name so that I can find weather details for my desired location.
- As a user, I want to see real-time weather updates so that I can plan my activities based on current conditions.
- As a user, I want a visually appealing display of weather data (temperature, humidity, and wind speeds) so that I can enjoy a pleasant experience.
- As a user, I want responsive design so that I can use the app on both desktop and mobile devices.
- As a user, I want error notifications for invalid city names or connection issues so that I can understand what went wrong.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] The app displays weather data (temperature, humidity, wind speed) for any valid city input.
- [ ] Users can see a 5-day weather forecast displayed in a visually appealing format.
- [ ] The design works across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile) with good responsiveness.
- [ ] Error messages are displayed when the user inputs invalid city names or API errors occur.
- [ ] The app handles API rate limits gracefully (e.g., caching or throttling).

## Technical Requirements
- Integrate OpenWeatherMap API using the free tier key (`c4b27d06b0817cd09f83aa58745fda97`).
- Secure the API key using an environment variable (`.env.local`).
- Build the frontend using React.js with reusable components for clean and modular development.
- Implement styling with TailwindCSS for a responsive and aesthetic UI.
- Centralize API logic with a custom hook for data fetching and error handling.
- Deploy the app on a platform like Vercel or Netlify with production optimizations.

## Out of Scope
- No user accounts or authentication features will be implemented.
- No advanced customization options for charts or interface.
- No integration with paid OpenWeatherMap API features (e.g., historical data).
- No server-side rendering or backend services.
