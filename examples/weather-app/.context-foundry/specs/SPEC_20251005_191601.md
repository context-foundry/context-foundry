## Goal
Create a beautiful, user-friendly, web-based weather app that displays real-time weather data using the free OpenWeatherMap API.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to search for the current weather in any city so that I can have real-time weather information before making plans.
- As a user, I want to see additional weather details (e.g., humidity, wind speed) so that I can be better prepared for a variety of conditions.
- As a user, I want to view a multi-day weather forecast so that I can plan for the week ahead.
- As a user, I want the app to work on mobile and desktop devices so that I can check the weather from any device.
- As a user, I want visually appealing and intuitive designs so that the app is easy and enjoyable to use.
- As a user, I want informative error messages (e.g., invalid city name) so that the app feels reliable and responsive.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Users can search for and view current weather in any valid city.
- [ ] Additional weather details (e.g., humidity, wind speed) are presented.
- [ ] A 5-day weather forecast feature is implemented and accessible.
- [ ] The app is mobile-responsive and works across different screen sizes.
- [ ] Modern UI styling with consistent, elegant design is implemented.
- [ ] Errors (e.g., invalid location or network issues) are handled gracefully with clear messages.
- [ ] The API key usage complies with OpenWeatherMap's rate limits.

## Technical Requirements
- Use React for the frontend framework.
- Use TailwindCSS for modern, responsive styling with utility-first classes.
- Use Axios for HTTP requests to integrate with the OpenWeatherMap API.
- Support caching or throttling for API calls to handle rate limiting gracefully.
- Deploy the app through Netlify or Vercel with CI/CD pipelines.
- Organize files following the proposed modular file structure for better maintainability.

## Out of Scope
- Advanced weather data features such as radar maps or historical weather data.
- User authentication or account management.
- Offline functionality or Progressive Web App (PWA) optimizations.
