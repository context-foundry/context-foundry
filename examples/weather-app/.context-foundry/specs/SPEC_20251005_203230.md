## Goal
Create a responsive web-based weather application that displays current weather data based on user location using the OpenWeatherMap API.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to enter my location so that I can see the current weather conditions in my area.
- As a user, I want to see real-time updates for the weather forecast so that I can plan my activities accordingly.
- As a user, I want a visually appealing and intuitive interface so that I enjoy using the application.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] The application successfully fetches weather data for any given location using the OpenWeatherMap API.
- [ ] The user can view the temperature, weather condition, humidity, and wind speed of their location.
- [ ] The interface is responsive across different devices, including mobile and desktop.
- [ ] The application provides feedback to users in case of errors (e.g., location not found, network issues).

## Technical Requirements
- Fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API using Axios.
- Implement user location detection via the Geolocation API.
- Ensure responsiveness using a CSS framework (e.g., Tailwind CSS).
- Use a state management solution (e.g., Redux or React Context API) for managing application state.

## Out of Scope
- The application will not provide historical weather data or long-range forecasts (beyond current and next few days).
- User account management or saving favorite locations is not part of this version.
