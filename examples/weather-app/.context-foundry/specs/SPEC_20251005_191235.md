## Goal
To develop a beautiful, responsive, web-based weather application that provides real-time weather information using the OpenWeatherMap API, targeting seamless user experience and accessible deployment.

## User Stories
- As a general user, I want to search for current weather information by city name so that I can view real-time weather details for any location.
- As a user, I want the app to detect my location automatically so that I can quickly check my local weather.
- As a user, I want the displayed weather data to include temperature, humidity, wind speed, and condition, so that I get clear and concise weather updates.
- As a user, I want the app to handle invalid city names or API errors gracefully so that I understand what went wrong without confusion.
- As a user, I want the app to work seamlessly across devices so that I can access the weather data on mobile, tablet, or desktop.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] The user can search for weather information by city name and receive accurate results.
- [ ] The app can automatically detect the user’s location and display the weather.
- [ ] Weather data includes temperature, humidity, wind speed, and condition.
- [ ] The app provides clear error handling for invalid API calls or network issues.
- [ ] The app is visually appealing, responsive, and works seamlessly across devices.
- [ ] The API key is securely managed during development and deployment.

## Technical Requirements
- Utilize the OpenWeatherMap API’s free-tier endpoint for weather data.
- Build the frontend using React.js for dynamic UI and state management.
- Style the application using Tailwind CSS for responsive design.
- Use Vite as the bundler for fast builds and optimized production.
- Secure the API key during development using `.env` files and environment variable injection in hosting.
- Host the app on a free hosting platform (e.g., Netlify or Vercel).

## Out of Scope
- Historical or forecasted weather data; focus on current real-time weather only.
- Building a backend system; API calls will be made directly from the client-side.
- Premium features (e.g., maps, extended weather reports) requiring advanced tier OpenWeatherMap APIs.
