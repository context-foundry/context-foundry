## Goal
Develop a beautiful, responsive web-based weather application using the free OpenWeatherMap API to provide users with real-time weather information and forecasts.

## User Stories
- As a visitor, I want to search for current weather by city so that I can quickly check the conditions anywhere.
- As a user, I want weather data based on my geolocation so that I donâ€™t need to input my location manually.
- As a user, I want to view the 5-day weather forecast so that I can plan ahead over the week.
- As a user, I want the app to work on my mobile, tablet, and desktop so that I can access weather data across all my devices.
- As a user, I want a visually appealing interface so that viewing weather data feels enjoyable and intuitive.
- As a cautious user, I want clear error messages if my search fails, so that I understand how to fix any issues.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Display current weather data for cities based on user search inputs.
- [ ] Provide geolocation-based weather data if permission is granted.
- [ ] Show 5-day weather forecasts including temperature, humidity, and condition summaries.
- [ ] Ensure the app is fully responsive on mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes.
- [ ] Achieve a visually appealing design with smooth interactions and animations.
- [ ] Gracefully handle and display errors (e.g., invalid city names or API issues).

## Technical Requirements
- Use the OpenWeatherMap API (`https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/`) for weather and forecast data.
- Implement dynamic UI rendering using vanilla JavaScript or React.
- Ensure geolocation functionality using the native `navigator.geolocation` API.
- Use CSS or a library like TailwindCSS for responsive and modern styling.
- Implement caching for API responses to optimize requests and handle API rate limits gracefully.
- Ensure browser compatibility across modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
- Provide clear error handling to users when encountering API/data issues.

## Out of Scope
- Integration with paid OpenWeatherMap API (free tier only).
- Advanced forecast visualization (e.g., charts or graphs beyond simple summaries).
- PWA (Progressive Web App) or offline capabilities.
