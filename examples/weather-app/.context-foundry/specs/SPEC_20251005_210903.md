## Goal
Create a beautiful and functional web-based weather application that seamlessly integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API to provide users with current weather information based on their location input.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to enter my location so that I can see the current weather conditions for that area.
- As a user, I want the app to display weather information in a visually appealing format so that I can easily understand the forecast.
- As a user, I want the ability to clear my input and start over so that I can search for different locations without issues.
- As a user, I want the weather data to update dynamically upon input submission so that I do not have to refresh the page.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] The application successfully fetches weather data based on user input and displays it without errors.
- [ ] The UI is responsive and visually appealing on both desktop and mobile devices.
- [ ] Users can search for at least 5 different locations and view their respective weather data.
- [ ] The application gracefully handles API errors and displays a user-friendly message.

## Technical Requirements
- Integration with the OpenWeatherMap API using Axios for making API requests.
- Use of a modern CSS framework (like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS) for responsive design.
- Minimal and organized JavaScript code in `app.js`, `api.js`, and `store.js` for handling application logic and state management.
- Clear and concise HTML structure in `index.html` for improved SEO and accessibility.

## Out of Scope
- The application will not include a forecast feature beyond current weather conditions.
- User account management and authentication will not be part of this project.
