- As a user, I want to see temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions so that I can make informed decisions
- As a user, I want to see weather icons that match current conditions so that I can quickly understand the weather

### Location Management
- As a user, I want to search for weather in different cities so that I can check conditions in other locations
- As a user, I want the app to detect my current location automatically so that I don't have to manually enter it
- As a user, I want to save favorite locations so that I can quickly access weather for places I care about

### Extended Information
- As a user, I want to see a 5-day weather forecast so that I can plan ahead
- As a user, I want to see detailed metrics (feels like, pressure, visibility, UV index) so that I have comprehensive weather information
- As a user, I want to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit so that I can use my preferred temperature units

### User Experience
- As a user, I want the app to work well on my mobile device so that I can check weather on the go
- As a user, I want fast loading times so that I can quickly get weather information
- As a user, I want clear error messages when something goes wrong so that I understand what happened
- As a user, I want a dark/light theme toggle so that I can use the app comfortably in different lighting conditions

## Success Criteria
