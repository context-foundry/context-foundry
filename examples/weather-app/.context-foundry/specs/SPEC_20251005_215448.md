## User Stories
- As a user, I want to input a city name so that I can see the current weather for that location.
- As a user, I want to view the weather data, including temperature, humidity, and weather conditions, so that I can plan my day accordingly.
- As a user, I want to see an error message if the city name is invalid or not found so that I know to try again.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Users can successfully input a city name and retrieve weather data.
- [ ] Weather information is displayed accurately, including at least temperature, humidity, and description.
- [ ] Users are shown an error message for invalid city names.

## Technical Requirements
- Utilize React (or a similar framework) for the front-end development.

## Out of Scope
- Historical weather data and forecasts beyond the current conditions.
