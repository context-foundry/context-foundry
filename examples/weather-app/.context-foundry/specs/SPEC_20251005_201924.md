## Goal
Develop a responsive, visually appealing web-based weather application that provides real-time weather data and forecasts using the OpenWeatherMap API, ensuring ease of use and compatibility across devices.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to search for weather information by city name so that I can see current weather conditions and forecasts.
- As a user, I want the app to show weather conditions based on my geolocation so that I can quickly check the weather in my current location.
- As a user, I want to see an intuitive user interface with weather icons, temperature, humidity, and conditions clearly displayed so that the information is easy to understand.
- As a user, I want a 5-day forecast feature so that I can plan my activities accordingly.
- As a developer, I want to ensure secure handling of API keys so that sensitive data isnâ€™t exposed.
- As a user, I want the app to perform well on both mobile and desktop devices so that I can access it anywhere.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Capability to search weather by city name with results displayed accurately.
- [ ] Capability to fetch weather data based on user geolocation permissions.
- [ ] Weather data includes temperature, humidity, weather conditions, and forecast displayed with modern, responsive UI styling.
- [ ] Seamless UX experience with error handling for invalid city names or denied geolocation access.
- [ ] API key securely stored in environment variables and not exposed publicly.
- [ ] Responsive design enabling usability across desktop and mobile devices.

## Technical Requirements
- React.js for building a dynamic single-page application (SPA).
- Tailwind CSS for styling with mobile-first responsiveness.
- OpenWeatherMap API integrated via HTTP requests using Fetch API or Axios.
- Geolocation API for location-based weather data retrieval.
- Modular React components for scalability (e.g., `SearchBar.jsx`, `WeatherDisplay.jsx`).
- Environment variables (`.env`) for secure API key storage.

## Out of Scope
- Developing a backend server or database for user data storage.
- Advanced weather visualizations like radar maps or precipitation heatmaps.
- Paid features of the OpenWeatherMap API beyond the free tier.
- Native mobile app development.
