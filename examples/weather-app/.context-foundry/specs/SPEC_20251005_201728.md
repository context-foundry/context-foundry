## Goal
Develop a mobile-friendly, visually appealing weather application that dynamically retrieves and displays current weather data and forecasts using the OpenWeatherMap API.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to search for the weather in any city so that I can plan my activities accordingly.
- As a user, I want to see detailed weather data, including temperature, humidity, and conditions, so that I can understand the current conditions.
- As a user, I want the app to save my previous searches so that I can access weather information for the cities I care about without searching again.
- As a user, I want the app to display data quickly and handle errors gracefully so that I can use it without frustration.
- As a user, I want the app to work well on my mobile phone so that I can check the weather on the go.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Users can input a city name and view current weather details such as temperature, conditions, and humidity.
- [ ] Users can view forecasts for the upcoming days in a visually clean layout.
- [ ] Recent searches are cached and accessible when the user revisits the app.
- [ ] The app responds quickly, with loading states for API calls and clear error handling for failed requests.
- [ ] The UI is fully responsive, adjusting seamlessly across devices with different screen sizes.
- [ ] The app is visually engaging and adheres to modern design principles.

## Technical Requirements
- Use the OpenWeatherMap API with the provided API key for weather data retrieval.
- The app architecture should follow the MVC pattern for clean separation of concerns.
- Implement reusable UI components such as `SearchBar`, `WeatherCard`, and `ForecastList`.
- Support geolocation-based weather retrieval via the browser's Geolocation API.
- Implement caching mechanisms for recent searches (e.g., via `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`).
- Use SCSS for styling with modular structure to keep file organization clean.
- Include loaders, error messages, and visual feedback for synchronous operations.
- Ensure minimal API requests through debouncing and caching.

## Out of Scope
- Advanced functionality such as hourly weather updates and radar maps.
- Non-English translations/localization.
- Premium OpenWeatherMap API features requiring a paid subscription.
- Back-end architecture or databases; this is a front-end-only application.
