## Approach
Develop a Single Page Application (SPA) using plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, allowing for smooth interactions without page reloads. The application will fetch data from the OpenWeatherMap API based on user input and will use local storage to manage recent searches.

## Architecture Decisions
| Decision                  | Options Considered                 | Choice                    | Rationale                               |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Framework/Library        | Vanilla JS, React, Vue, Angular   | Vanilla JS               | Simplicity and minimal project scope.  |
| Data fetching method     | Axios, Fetch API                  | Fetch API                | Native to the browser, reducing dependencies. |
| Data storage             | Session Storage, Local Storage     | Local Storage            | Allows persistence across app sessions. |

## Implementation Phases
1. **Phase 1**: Set up project structure and create the basic HTML layout. Implement the CSS for responsive design.
2. **Phase 2**: Implement API calls to fetch weather data and display it within the application. Add input validation and error handling.
3. **Phase 3**: Implement local storage functionality for recent searches and enhance UI/UX with additional features like loading indicators.

## Testing Strategy
Validation will be done through manual testing and browser dev tools to check API responses and ensure that error handling works. Use console logs and error messages on the UI to ensure correctness.

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk                          | Probability | Impact  | Mitigation                                          |
|-------------------------------|-------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------|
| API Rate Limiting             | Medium      | High    | Implement retries and graceful error handling.     |
| CORS Issues                   | Low         | Medium  | Ensure proper request headers; test with local server. |
| Data Consistency Problems      | Low         | High    | Use consistent units and standardization in displaying data. |
