## Goal
To build a beautiful web-based weather application that provides current weather information and forecasts using the OpenWeatherMap API.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to enter a city name so that I can see the current weather conditions in that location.
- As a user, I want to view a detailed weather display including temperature, humidity, and weather conditions so that I can prepare accordingly.
- As a user, I want a clean and intuitive interface so that I can easily navigate and access the weather information I need.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] The application allows users to input a city name and displays current weather data within 5 seconds of submission.
- [ ] The applicationâ€™s UI is responsive and visually appealing across different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- [ ] Appropriate error messages are displayed when an invalid city name is entered or when the API call fails.

## Technical Requirements
- Implement a front-end using React and Axios for making API calls.
- Use the OpenWeatherMap API for fetching weather data.
- Ensure the application is responsive and utilizes a modern CSS framework for styling (e.g., Bootstrap or TailwindCSS).
