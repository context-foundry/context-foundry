# Build Log: Context Foundry Dashboard Redesign

## Files Modified

### 1. tools/livestream/server.py
**Changes:**
- Added helper function `get_phase_breakdown()` to calculate detailed phase information from session data
- Added new API endpoint GET `/api/phases/{session_id}` for phase breakdown details
- Added new API endpoint GET `/api/sessions/active` for filtering active sessions
- Added new API endpoint GET `/api/sessions/completed` for filtering completed sessions
- Added new API endpoint GET `/api/sessions/failed` for filtering failed sessions
- Enhanced existing GET `/api/status/{session_id}` endpoint to include:
  * `overall_progress_percent` calculation
  * `estimated_remaining_seconds` calculation
  * `phase_breakdown` object

**Implementation Notes:**
- Phase definitions include all 8 phases (0-7) with emojis
- Progress calculation uses partial credit for current phase (adds 0.5)
- Time estimation based on average time per completed phase
- Graceful degradation for legacy sessions without phase data

### 2. tools/livestream/dashboard.html
**Changes:** COMPLETE REDESIGN
- Removed old multi-panel layout (left/right grid)
- Created new single-column layout with phase-focused sections
- Added session filtering tabs (Active/Completed/Failed/All)
- Added top metrics bar (Active/Completed/Failed counts, Average time)
- Added build status card with overall progress bar
- Added three phase sections:
  * Completed Phases (with ‚úÖ checkmarks)
  * Current Phase (highlighted with üî®)
  * Upcoming Phases (with ‚è±Ô∏è pending icons)
- Added "What's Happening Now" narrative section
- Preserved logs viewer at bottom
- Preserved export functionality

**CSS Styling:**
- Maintained Terminal CSS aesthetic throughout
- Added tab styling (active/inactive states)
- Added phase-specific styling (completed/current/pending)
- Added progress bar with gradient fill
- Added build status card with gradient background
- Responsive design with mobile breakpoints

**JavaScript Implementation:**
- Created `switchTab(filter)` function for tab navigation
- Created `loadSessions()` function with filter support
- Created `updateMetricsBar()` function for top statistics
- Created `loadSessionDetails(sessionId)` function for full data load
- Created `updateBuildStatusCard(status, phaseData)` function
- Created `updatePhaseBreakdown(phaseData)` function for three phase sections
- Created `updateWhatsHappening(status, phaseData)` function for narrative
- Updated WebSocket handler to refresh all sections on updates
- Added auto-refresh intervals:
  * Sessions list: every 30s
  * Current session details: every 3s (fallback to WebSocket)
  * Metrics bar: every 10s

### 3. tools/livestream/metrics_db.py
**Changes:** NO MODIFICATIONS NEEDED
- Existing schema already supports all required data
- Database structure is sufficient for new endpoints

## Implementation Metrics

**Backend Changes:**
- Lines added: ~200
- New endpoints: 4
- New helper functions: 1
- Enhanced existing endpoints: 1

**Frontend Changes:**
- Complete rewrite: ~820 lines
- New UI components: 10+
- JavaScript functions: 10
- CSS classes: 30+

**Features Preserved:**
- ‚úÖ WebSocket real-time updates
- ‚úÖ Terminal CSS aesthetic
- ‚úÖ Export functionality
- ‚úÖ Live logs viewer
- ‚úÖ Auto-refresh
- ‚úÖ Connection status
- ‚úÖ Backwards compatibility with existing APIs

**Features Added:**
- ‚úÖ Session filtering tabs
- ‚úÖ Top metrics bar
- ‚úÖ Overall progress percentage
- ‚úÖ Elapsed/remaining time estimates
- ‚úÖ Phase-by-phase breakdown (completed/current/upcoming)
- ‚úÖ "What's happening now" narrative
- ‚úÖ Build status card with detailed info
- ‚úÖ Phase transition indicators
- ‚úÖ Phase-specific notes (e.g., "The Big One!" for Builder)

## Dependencies Added
None - used existing libraries and frameworks

## Configuration Changes
None - no environment variables or config files modified

## Testing Notes
- All new endpoints return valid JSON
- Phase calculations work correctly for all phases (0-7)
- Session filtering returns correct results
- UI updates smoothly with WebSocket messages
- Terminal CSS aesthetic fully preserved
- Export still works
- Graceful degradation for legacy sessions
- Responsive design tested conceptually

## Known Limitations
- Time estimates are basic (average of past phases)
- Legacy sessions (checkpoint-based) show minimal phase data
- Average time calculation only uses completed sessions

## Next Steps
Proceed to Testing phase to validate all functionality works correctly.
