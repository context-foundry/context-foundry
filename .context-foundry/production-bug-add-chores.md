# Production Bug Found: Add Chores Button Hidden

**Date:** October 19, 2025
**Reporter:** User testing
**Severity:** HIGH
**Status:** Identified, Pattern Created

---

## Bug Description

**User Report:**
> "the ability to add chores is broken. otherwise, everything else seems to be working well"

**Actual Issue:**
The "Add Chore" button is **hidden** when not in parent mode, rather than disabled with guidance.

---

## Root Cause

### Code Analysis

**File:** `src/pages/ChoresPage.js` lines 37-39

```javascript
if (user.parentMode) {
  header.appendChild(addBtn);
}
```

**Problem:**
The button is only added to the DOM when `user.parentMode === true`. If the user hasn't entered parent mode (via PIN), the button doesn't exist at all.

**Why This Is Bad UX:**
1. **Invisible Failure:** User doesn't know WHY they can't add chores
2. **No Guidance:** No indication that parent mode is required
3. **Confusing State:** App appears "broken" rather than "locked"
4. **Lost Feature:** Critical functionality is completely hidden

---

## Why Tests Didn't Catch This

### Test Coverage Gap

**Tests That Passed:**
- Unit tests for `ChoresPage()` function
- Unit tests for `store.addChore()`
- Integration tests for chore flow

**What They Missed:**
- **UX flow testing:** "Can a user discover how to add chores?"
- **State-dependent UI:** "Is critical functionality discoverable in all states?"
- **User journey testing:** "What happens if I try to add a chore but I'm not in parent mode?"

**Why They Missed It:**
1. **jsdom doesn't test discoverability** - Tests check IF functionality works when called, not WHETHER users can find it
2. **No UI/UX tests** - Missing "smoke tests" for critical user flows
3. **No accessibility tests** - Missing checks for hidden critical features
4. **Happy path bias** - Tests assumed user is already in parent mode

---

## Expected Behavior vs. Actual Behavior

### Actual Behavior
```
User NOT in parent mode:
→ Chores page loads
→ "Add Chore" button is invisible
→ User confused: "Where's the add button?"
→ User thinks app is broken
```

### Expected Behavior (Better UX)
```
User NOT in parent mode:
→ Chores page loads
→ "Add Chore" button is visible but disabled
→ Button shows tooltip: "🔒 Enter Parent Mode to add chores"
→ Clicking button shows modal: "Parent PIN required. Go to Parent page?"
→ User understands requirement
```

---

## Recommended Fix

### Option 1: Always Show Button with State Indication (RECOMMENDED)

```javascript
const addBtn = Button('Add Chore', {
  variant: 'primary',
  icon: user.parentMode ? '+' : '🔒',
  onClick: () => {
    if (user.parentMode) {
      showAddChoreModal();
    } else {
      showParentModeRequiredModal();
    }
  },
  disabled: !user.parentMode,
  title: user.parentMode ? '' : 'Parent Mode required to add chores'
});

header.appendChild(addBtn); // ALWAYS append
```

### Option 2: Show Placeholder When Not in Parent Mode

```javascript
if (user.parentMode) {
  header.appendChild(addBtn);
} else {
  const lockedMessage = document.createElement('div');
  lockedMessage.className = 'locked-feature';
  lockedMessage.innerHTML = `
    <button class="btn btn-secondary" disabled>
      🔒 Add Chore
    </button>
    <span class="help-text">Enter Parent Mode to add chores</span>
  `;
  header.appendChild(lockedMessage);
}
```

### Option 3: Add Helper Text

```javascript
header.appendChild(title);
if (user.parentMode) {
  header.appendChild(addBtn);
} else {
  const hint = document.createElement('p');
  hint.className = 'hint-text';
  hint.innerHTML = '🔒 Enter <a href="#/parent">Parent Mode</a> to add chores';
  header.appendChild(hint);
}
```

## Impact Analysis

### User Impact
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Affects:** All users not in parent mode
- **Workaround:** User must discover they need to enter parent mode (non-obvious)
- **First-time user experience:** POOR - appears broken
- **Frustration level:** HIGH

### Business Impact
- **Adoption risk:** Users may abandon app thinking it's broken
- **Support burden:** Likely to generate support requests
- **Trust erosion:** "If this doesn't work, what else is broken?"

## Pattern for Future Builds

### Pattern ID: `hidden-critical-features`

**Title:** Don't Hide Critical Features Behind State Without Guidance

**Category:** UX/UI, State Management

**Rule:**
Critical features should NEVER be completely hidden based on application state. Always provide:
1. Visual indication the feature exists
2. Clear explanation of why it's unavailable
3. Actionable guidance on how to unlock it

**Applies To:**
- Web applications
- Feature-gated functionality
- Permission-based UI
- Authentication-dependent features

**Detection:**
- Scout: Flag any conditional UI rendering of primary actions
- Architect: Require state-based UI patterns with guidance
- Test: Add UX smoke tests for critical flows in all states

**Prevention:**
```javascript
// ❌ BAD: Completely hide feature
if (hasPermission) {
  renderButton();
}

// ✅ GOOD: Show feature with state indication
renderButton({
  enabled: hasPermission,
  tooltip: hasPermission ? '' : 'Permission required',
  onClick: hasPermission ? action : showRequirementModal
});
```

**Auto-Apply:** TRUE for apps with user roles, permissions, or modes

---

## Test Pattern Updates

### New Test Requirement: Critical Feature Discoverability

**Test:** For each critical user action, verify it's discoverable in ALL application states

**Example:**
```javascript
describe('ChoresPage - All States', () => {
  it('should show add chore guidance when not in parent mode', () => {
    // Setup: user NOT in parent mode
    const user = { name: 'Kid', parentMode: false, parentPin: '1234' };
    store.setState({ user });

    ChoresPage();

    // Should STILL have indication of how to add chores
    const addButton = document.querySelector('[data-action="add-chore"]');
    const guidance = document.querySelector('.parent-mode-required');

    expect(addButton || guidance).toBeTruthy();
    expect(addButton?.disabled || guidance?.textContent).toContain('Parent');
  });
});
```

## Lessons Learned

### Testing Gaps

1. **Unit tests validate logic, not UX**
   - addChore() works ✅
   - But users can't find it ❌

2. **Integration tests check happy paths**
   - Tests assume user is in correct state
   - Don't test "wrong state" user experiences

3. **Missing smoke tests for critical flows**
   - "Can I add a chore?" should be tested in ALL states
   - Not just "Does addChore() work when called?"

### Architectural Improvements

1. **State-dependent UI needs guidance layer**
   - Don't just hide features
   - Show locked state + how to unlock

2. **Critical features need discoverability tests**
   - Add to test suite: "Is feature X findable in state Y?"

3. **User journey testing**
   - Test from user perspective, not code perspective
   - "I want to add a chore" → What happens?

## Feedback Loop Integration

### Update Pattern Library

**Files to Update:**
1. `test-patterns.json` - Add discoverability test pattern
2. `common-issues.json` - Add hidden-critical-features pattern
3. `scout-learnings.json` - Add state-dependent UI risk detection

### Apply to Future Builds

**Scout Phase:**
- Flag any conditional rendering of primary actions
- Warn: "Feature X only visible in state Y - add guidance?"

**Architect Phase:**
- Require state-based UI patterns include:
  - Disabled state with tooltip
  - Or guidance text explaining requirement
  - Or modal explaining how to unlock

**Test Phase:**
- Add discoverability smoke tests
- Test critical features in all application states
- Verify guidance exists for locked features

## Comparison: Test Results vs. Reality

### Test Results
```
✅ 60/68 tests passed (88.2%)
✅ addChore() unit tests: PASS
✅ ChoresPage() integration tests: PASS
✅ Parent mode tests: PASS
```

### Reality
```
❌ "Add chores is broken" - User report
❌ Critical feature hidden without guidance
❌ Poor first-time user experience
❌ No way to discover parent mode requirement
```

**Conclusion:** 88.2% test pass rate doesn't guarantee good UX!
