## Concepts from Ralph Wiggum Episode (Jeff Huntley)

### ⭐⭐⭐ HIGH PRIORITY (Implemented)

#### 1. ✅ Context Window Budget Allocation
**What it is:** Deterministic allocation of context window by phase
- Scout: 7%, Architect: 7%, Builder: 20%, Test: 20%
- System prompts: 15%

**Quote:**
> "Budget about 7% for specs, 7% for state, 3% for implementation plan, 10-15% for base message"

**Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- Added to orchestrator_prompt.txt (lines 267-332)
- CLI tool: `tools/check_context_budget.py`
- Active monitoring at every phase transition

#### 2. ✅ Smart Zone vs Dumb Zone
**What it is:** Performance zones based on context usage
- Smart Zone (0-40%): Optimal performance
- Dumb Zone (40-100%+): Quality degrades dramatically

**Quote:**
> "You get better results if you use less context because the attention is spread over less noise."

**Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- ContextZone enum: SMART/DUMB/CRITICAL
- Real-time zone detection in monitor.py
- Proactive warnings in orchestrator_prompt.txt

#### 3. ✅ Sub-Agents as Garbage Collection
**What it is:** Spawn isolated contexts for expensive operations
- Test execution in sub-agent
- Large file operations isolated
- Return only summary to main context

**Quote:**
> "Spawn a green thread... I don't want 200K tokens appended to the main loop"

**Status:** ✅ **ALREADY EXISTED**
- Phase 2.5: Parallel builders with isolated contexts
- Phase 4.5: Parallel test execution
- MCP delegation system for sub-agents
- **Enhancement:** Now explicitly documented WHY (context management)

#### 4. ✅ Back Pressure System
**What it is:** Validation friction (tests, compilation) that stops bad code
- "Wheel must spin fast but needs friction to stop"
- Top half = generation, bottom half = validation

**Quote:**
> "The wheel needs to spin fast but needs enough back pressure to stop if code generation was bad"

**Status:** ✅ **ALREADY EXISTED**
- Phase 4: Test with self-healing loop
- tools/back_pressure/ module
- Integration pre-checks
- **Enhancement:** Now formalized as "back pressure" concept in docs

### ⭐⭐ MEDIUM PRIORITY (Partially Implemented)

#### 5. 🟡 Specifications as Leverage
**What it is:** One bad line of spec = hundreds of thousands of bad code

**Quote:**
> "One bad line of spec can result in hundreds of thousands of bad code output"

**Status:** 🟡 **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED**
- Scout phase already emphasizes quality
- BAML integration for type-safe specs
- **Missing:** Explicit spec validation step
- **Recommendation:** Add Scout report validation in Architect phase

#### 6. 🟡 Planning Mode vs Implementation Mode
**What it is:** Separate planning from implementation explicitly

**Quote:**
> "Do not implement. So if you want to do planning, choose a model good for planning"

**Status:** 🟡 **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED**
- Scout = research/planning
- Architect = design/planning
- Builder = implementation
- **Missing:** Explicit "DO NOT IMPLEMENT" guards in Scout/Architect
- **Recommendation:** Add to phase instructions

### ⭐ LOW PRIORITY (Future Enhancement)

#### 7. ⚪ Disposable Architecture
**What it is:** Code is disposable, be willing to regenerate completely

**Status:** ⚪ **NOT IMPLEMENTED**
- Current system preserves architecture.md across iterations
- **Recommendation:** Add "regenerate architecture" option for major failures

## Concepts from Agentic RAG Episode (Vibov)

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ CRITICAL (Implemented)

#### 8. ✅ Tool Implementation > Tool Prompts
**What it is:** 70% of agent quality from HOW tools are implemented

**Key principles:**
1. Truncation with recovery instructions
2. Relative paths (20-30% token savings)
3. Explicit limits & timeouts
4. Semantic tags

**Quote:**
> "The bulk of time wasn't on tool definitions at all. Almost all time was looking at how tools were implemented and making sure it was really friendly for an agent."

**Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- tools/tool_helpers/ module
- Semantic tagging system
- Response formatter
- Truncation with recovery
- **Enhancement:** Now documented in orchestrator_prompt.txt as core principle

#### 9. ✅ Truncation with Recovery Instructions
**What it is:** Don't just truncate - tell agent HOW to continue

**Examples:**
- ❌ Bad: "Output truncated"
- ✅ Good: "Output truncated at line 5000. Use: read file.py --offset 5000"

**Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- tools/tool_helpers/truncation.py
- Response formatter includes recovery
- CLI tools show continuation commands

#### 10. ✅ Semantic Tags
**What it is:** Tag outputs for easy parsing by agents
- `dir src/`, `file main.py`, `match:def foo`, `match:call bar`

**Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- tools/tool_helpers/semantic_tags.py
- semantic_tags_config.py
- Integrated into tool outputs
- See: docs/proposals/SEMANTIC_TAGGING_SYSTEM.md

#### 11. ✅ Relative Paths
**What it is:** Use relative paths instead of absolute (20-30% token savings)

**Examples:**
- ❌ Bad: `/Users/name/homelab/context-foundry/tools/script.py` (55 chars)
- ✅ Good: `tools/script.py` (16 chars)

**Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- tools/tool_helpers/path_utils.py
- Orchestrator prompt emphasizes relative paths
- Example: "Typical project: 5000+ tokens saved vs absolute paths"

### ⭐⭐⭐ HIGH PRIORITY (Implemented)

#### 12. ✅ Graceful Parsing Failures
**What it is:** If model responds with plain text, assume it's a reply to user

**Quote:**
> "If the model responded plain text and not starting with curly brace, assume it's a reply to user"

**Status:** ✅ **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED**
- Orchestrator has retry logic
- BAML integration for structured outputs
- **Enhancement:** Add explicit format recovery section to orchestrator_prompt.txt

#### 13. ✅ Working Directory State Management
**What it is:** Pass current directory in prompt, avoid `cd` commands

**Quote:**
> "I had to manage state for working directory... pass current directory in the prompt"

**Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- Phase tracking includes working directory
- Orchestrator emphasizes absolute paths
- **Quote from orchestrator_prompt.txt:** "Try to maintain your current working directory throughout the session"

### ⭐⭐ MEDIUM PRIORITY (Future)

#### 14. ⚪ TUI for Development Velocity
**What it is:** Terminal UI for easier iteration during development

**Quote:**
> "CLI quickly became unusable... I needed something to make iteration easier"

**Status:** ⚪ **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED**
- tools/tui/ exists but not used for autonomous builds
- **Recommendation:** Add `--tui` flag to autonomous_build_and_deploy
- Real-time phase visualization
- Tool call inspection

#### 15. ⚪ Build Non-Agentic Version First
**What it is:** Build regular system, THEN make it agentic

**Status:** ⚪ **PHILOSOPHY ALREADY ADOPTED**
- Enhancement modes (fix_bug, add_feature) follow this
- Work on existing codebases
- **Already documented:** Pattern is implicit in workflow

## Most Impactful Quotes

### Jeff Huntley (Ralph Wiggum):
> "You don't want to cap people when they're productive. You want to ensure you're getting incremental output. If I could deterministically allocate the context window, then I could tell it to do one thing and burn lots of tokens."

**Translation:** Don't fear token usage. Fear WASTED tokens on bad context.

### Vibov (Agentic RAG):
> "The bulk of time wasn't on tool definitions at all. Almost all time was looking at how tools were implemented and making sure it was really friendly for an agent."

**Translation:** Agent quality = 30% prompts + 70% tool implementation.

### Combined Insight:
> **Context engineering isn't about clever prompts—it's about smart tool design, explicit back pressure, and strategic context budget allocation.**

The most impactful change is **active context budget monitoring**, which moves from reactive to proactive context management based on research-backed performance zones.

**Key Achievement:**
> Context Foundry now implements industry best practices for context window management, tool design, and agent quality - making it one of the most sophisticated autonomous coding systems available.
