# Pattern Merge Fix - Automatic Learning Loop

**Date:** 2025-10-21
**Status:** ✅ Implemented and Tested

## Problem

Context Foundry was capturing lessons learned from builds in local project feedback files (`.context-foundry/feedback/build-feedback-*.json`), but **never merging them back** into the global pattern database (`~/.context-foundry/patterns/common-issues.json`).

This meant:
- ❌ Patterns discovered in one build didn't help future builds
- ❌ `total_builds` counter never incremented
- ❌ The learning loop was broken - patterns stayed local

**Example:** The 1942-shooter build discovered 3 new input-handling patterns for games, but they would never be applied to future game builds.

## Root Cause

The `autonomous_build_and_deploy` MCP tool spawns a background Claude Code process that:
1. ✅ Runs Scout → Architect → Builder → Test → Deploy phases
2. ✅ Generates feedback file with lessons learned
3. ❌ **Never called `merge_project_patterns` to save to global database**

The merge had to be triggered manually, which users rarely did.

## Solution

Implemented **dual-layer automatic pattern merge** for reliability:

### Layer 1: Orchestrator Workflow (Primary)
The background Claude instance running the build now merges patterns during Phase 7 (Feedback)

### Layer 2: Result Check (Safety Net)
If orchestrator fails to merge, `get_delegation_result()` catches it when someone checks the build status

### Implementation

**Location:** `tools/mcp_server.py`, `get_delegation_result()` function, lines 743-788

**Logic:**
```python
# When build completes successfully
if is_autonomous_build and build_successful:
    # Find feedback file in .context-foundry/feedback/
    feedback_files = list(feedback_dir.glob("build-feedback-*.json"))
    if feedback_files:
        latest_feedback = max(feedback_files, key=lambda p: p.stat().st_mtime)

        # Merge patterns to global database
        merge_result_str = merge_project_patterns(
            project_pattern_file=str(latest_feedback),
            pattern_type="common-issues",
            increment_build_count=True
        )
```

**When it runs:**
- Only for autonomous builds (`build_type == "autonomous"`)
- Only on successful completion (`exit_code == 0`)
- Only if feedback file exists
- Non-blocking: merge failure doesn't break the build

**What it merges:**
- New patterns → Added to global database
- Existing patterns → Frequency incremented, `last_seen` updated
- Build counter → Incremented in global patterns file

## Testing

### Test Case: 1942-Shooter Build

**Before merge:**
```json
{
  "patterns": 13,
  "total_builds": 2,
  "last_updated": "2025-10-20T19:37:23"
}
```

**Feedback file contained 3 new patterns:**
1. `input-buffer-timing` (HIGH severity)
2. `input-consumption-toggles` (MEDIUM severity)
3. `pause-input-processing` (MEDIUM severity)

**After automatic merge:**
```json
{
  "patterns": 16,
  "total_builds": 3,
  "last_updated": "2025-10-21T11:45:48",
  "new_patterns": [
    "input-buffer-timing",
    "input-consumption-toggles",
    "pause-input-processing"
  ]
}
```

✅ **Success:** All 3 patterns merged, build count incremented

## Impact

### Before Fix
- Patterns stayed in local `.context-foundry/feedback/` directory
- Never propagated to global database
- Future builds repeated the same mistakes
- Manual merge required (rarely done)

### After Fix
- ✅ Patterns automatically merged on build completion
- ✅ Future builds benefit from past learnings
- ✅ Pattern database grows with each build
- ✅ Self-improving system across all projects

### Example Benefit

**Next game build** (after this fix) will automatically:
1. Receive the 3 input-handling patterns during Scout phase
2. Architect will design input systems with test-friendly buffers
3. Builder will implement key consumption for toggle actions
4. Tests will pass on first iteration (instead of requiring 3 fix cycles)

**Estimated time saved:** 15-30 minutes per game build + higher quality code

## Verification

To verify pattern merge is working:

```bash
# Check global patterns after a build
cat ~/.context-foundry/patterns/common-issues.json | jq '{
  total_builds: .total_builds,
  pattern_count: (.patterns | length),
  last_updated: .last_updated
}'

# Check for specific patterns
cat ~/.context-foundry/patterns/common-issues.json | \
  jq '.patterns[] | select(.pattern_id | contains("input"))'
```

Expected behavior:
- `total_builds` increments after each autonomous build
- New patterns appear in global database
- `last_updated` timestamp updates

## Files Modified

1. **`tools/mcp_server.py`**
   - Lines 743-788: Added automatic pattern merge logic (backup/safety net)
   - Function: `get_delegation_result()`
   - Triggered when build status is checked after completion
   - Purpose: Catches patterns if Feedback phase fails

2. **`tools/orchestrator_prompt.txt`**
   - Lines 1045-1073: Simplified pattern merge instructions
   - Lines 1145-1179: Added verification and error handling
   - Phase 7 (Feedback): Instructs background Claude to merge patterns
   - Purpose: Primary automatic merge during build workflow

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Pattern Effectiveness Tracking**
   ```json
   {
     "pattern_id": "cors-es6-modules",
     "times_applied_preventatively": 5,
     "times_prevented": 5,
     "prevention_success_rate": "100%"
   }
   ```

2. **Explicit Pattern Application Logging**
   - Scout phase logs: "Applied pattern: cors-es6-modules (prevented 2x)"
   - Makes pattern usage visible and trackable

3. **Pattern Merge Notification**
   - Show in build completion summary
   - Display which new patterns were learned

4. **Selective Pattern Merge**
   - Merge successful patterns and failed attempts separately
   - Track pattern applicability by project type
