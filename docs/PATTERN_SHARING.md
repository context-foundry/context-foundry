# Pattern Sharing System

**Share your learnings, help the community build better projects**

Context Foundry learns from every build. When patterns are shared across the community, everyone benefits from accumulated knowledge about common issues, proven solutions, and best practices.

## Quick Start

After running some Context Foundry builds:

```bash
# Share your learned patterns with the community
cd ~/homelab/context-foundry
./scripts/share-my-patterns.sh
```

That's it! Your patterns will be validated and automatically merged if all checks pass.

## How It Works

### The Pattern Learning Cycle

```

## When to Share

### Good Times to Share

✅ **After successful builds** - Patterns that helped solve real problems

✅ **After fixing build failures** - Learnings from debugging sessions

✅ **Weekly/Monthly** - Accumulate patterns, then share in batch

✅ **When you have 5+ new patterns** - Makes the PR more valuable

### Don't Share If...

❌ **You haven't run any builds yet** - No patterns to share

❌ **Testing/experimenting** - Wait until patterns are proven

❌ **Patterns contain sensitive info** - See [Privacy & Security](#privacy--security)

---

## Sharing Your Patterns

### Step 1: Run the Script

```bash
cd ~/homelab/context-foundry
./scripts/share-my-patterns.sh
```

### Step 2: Review Summary

The script will show what you're about to share:

```
📊 Pattern Summary
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  📄 common-issues.json
     → 12 common issue patterns

  📄 scout-learnings.json
     → 8 scout learnings

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Share these patterns with the community? (y/N)
```

### Step 3: Confirm

Press `y` to continue. The script will:

1. ✅ Create a feature branch (`patterns/{username}/{timestamp}`)
2. ✅ Merge your patterns intelligently
3. ✅ Commit changes
4. ✅ Push to GitHub
5. ✅ Create a pull request

### Step 4: Wait for Auto-Merge

The PR will be automatically validated and merged (usually within 2-3 minutes).

---

## What Happens Next

### Automatic Validation

When you create a PR, GitHub Actions runs these checks:

| Check | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| **JSON Syntax** | Ensures all files are valid JSON |
| **Duplicate IDs** | Prevents duplicate pattern_id or learning_id |
| **Required Fields** | Validates all required fields are present |
| **Severity Levels** | Checks severity is CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW |
| **Merge Integrity** | Tests that merge doesn't corrupt data |

### Auto-Merge

If all checks pass and the PR has `patterns` and `automated` labels:

1. ✅ PR is automatically approved
2. ✅ Auto-merge is enabled
3. ✅ Branch is deleted after merge

You'll receive a GitHub notification when it's merged.

### Nightly Release

The next nightly release (midnight UTC) will:

1. ✅ Include your merged patterns
2. ✅ Tag a new nightly version (`v{VERSION}-nightly.{DATE}`)
3. ✅ Generate release notes mentioning pattern updates

Anyone who pulls/clones Context Foundry will get your patterns!

## Pattern Types

### Common Issues (`common-issues.json`)

**Purpose:** Problems encountered during builds and their solutions

**Example Pattern:**

```json
{
  "pattern_id": "python-fastapi-cors-missing",
  "title": "CORS not configured for FastAPI",
  "first_seen": "2025-10-15",
  "last_seen": "2025-10-20",
  "frequency": 3,
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "project_types": ["python-api", "fastapi", "web-api"],
  "issue": "FastAPI app works locally but fails in browser due to missing CORS",
  "solution": {
    "architect": "Include fastapi.middleware.cors in architecture",
    "builder": "Add CORSMiddleware with allow_origins=['*'] for development",
    "tester": "Test API from browser console to verify CORS headers"
  },
  "auto_apply": true
}
```

**Fields:**
- `pattern_id`: Unique kebab-case identifier
- `title`: Human-readable description
- `first_seen` / `last_seen`: Date tracking
- `frequency`: How many times this was encountered
- `severity`: CRITICAL | HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW
- `project_types`: Where this applies
- `issue`: Problem description
- `solution`: Phase-specific guidance (scout, architect, builder, tester)
- `auto_apply`: Whether to automatically apply this pattern

### Scout Learnings (`scout-learnings.json`)

**Purpose:** Research insights from the Scout phase

**Example Learning:**

```json
{
  "learning_id": "textual-framework-2025",
  "category": "framework",
  "project_types": ["tui-application", "cli-tool"],
  "key_points": [
    "Textual 0.40+ has breaking changes from 0.38",
    "App.run() is now async in latest version",
    "CSS system completely redesigned"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Pin textual version in pyproject.toml",
    "Use textual>=0.40.0 for new projects",
    "Include textual-dev for live reloading during development"
  ],
  "antipatterns": [
    "Using textual without version constraint",
    "Mixing async and sync event handlers"
  ],
  "first_seen": "2025-10-18",
  "confidence": "high"
}
```

**Fields:**
- `learning_id`: Unique identifier
- `category`: library | framework | best-practice | architecture | tooling | deployment
- `project_types`: Applicable project types
- `key_points`: Main takeaways
- `recommendations`: What to do
- `antipatterns`: What to avoid
- `confidence`: high | medium | low

## Privacy & Security

### What Gets Shared

✅ **Shared:**
- Pattern IDs and descriptions
- Error types and solutions
- Technology stack information
- Best practices and learnings

❌ **NOT Shared:**
- Your actual code
- Project names
- File paths
- API keys or secrets
- Personal information

### Review Before Sharing

The script shows you exactly what will be shared before creating the PR. Always review:

1. ✅ No project-specific file paths
2. ✅ No API keys or credentials
3. ✅ No proprietary business logic
4. ✅ Only generic, reusable patterns

### Opting Out

Don't want to share patterns? Simply don't run the script. Your local patterns in `~/.context-foundry/patterns/` stay private.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "gh CLI is not installed"

Install GitHub CLI:

```bash
# macOS
brew install gh

# Linux
sudo apt install gh

# Or download from: https://cli.github.com/
```

### "gh is not authenticated"

Authenticate with GitHub:

```bash
gh auth login
```

Follow the prompts to authenticate.

### "Git repository has uncommitted changes"

Commit or stash your changes first:

```bash
git status
git add .
git commit -m "your changes"

# Then try again
./scripts/share-my-patterns.sh
```

### "No local patterns found"

This means you haven't run any Context Foundry builds yet:

```bash
# Run a build first
cd ~/homelab/context-foundry
python3 tools/mcp_server.py

# In Claude Code or Claude Desktop:
# Use autonomous_build_and_deploy() to run a build
# Then patterns will be saved to ~/.context-foundry/patterns/
```

### PR Validation Failed

If the validation workflow fails:

1. Check the GitHub Actions log for details
2. Fix the issue in your local patterns
3. Run the script again (creates a new PR)

Common validation failures:
- Invalid JSON syntax
- Duplicate pattern IDs
- Missing required fields
- Invalid severity level

---

## Advanced Usage

### Manual Pattern Merge

If you want to merge patterns without creating a PR:

```bash
python3 scripts/merge-patterns-intelligent.py \
  --source ~/.context-foundry/patterns/common-issues.json \
  --dest .context-foundry/patterns/common-issues.json \
  --type common-issues \
  --output merged-common-issues.json
```

### Test Merge Locally

Before sharing, test the merge:

```bash
# Create temp directory
TEMP_DIR=$(mktemp -d)

# Test merge
python3 scripts/merge-patterns-intelligent.py \
  --source ~/.context-foundry/patterns/common-issues.json \
  --dest .context-foundry/patterns/common-issues.json \
  --type common-issues \
  --output "$TEMP_DIR/test-merge.json"

# Review output
cat "$TEMP_DIR/test-merge.json" | jq .

# Cleanup
rm -rf "$TEMP_DIR"
```

### Selective Sharing

If you only want to share specific patterns:

1. Create a temporary copy of your patterns directory
2. Remove patterns you don't want to share
3. Point the script to the temporary directory (edit the script)
4. Run the script

**Better approach:** Just edit your local `~/.context-foundry/patterns/*.json` files to remove patterns you don't want to share before running the script.

### Check Pattern Stats

See what patterns you have locally:

```bash
# Common issues
jq '{
  total_patterns: (.patterns | length),
  total_builds: .total_builds,
  last_updated: .last_updated
}' ~/.context-foundry/patterns/common-issues.json

# Scout learnings
jq '{
  total_learnings: (.learnings | length),
  categories: [.learnings[].category] | unique,
  last_updated: .last_updated
}' ~/.context-foundry/patterns/scout-learnings.json
```

## FAQ

**Q: How often should I share patterns?**
A: Whenever you have valuable learnings! Weekly or monthly is a good cadence.

**Q: Will my patterns be attributed to me?**

**Q: Can I see what patterns exist globally?**
A: Yes! Browse `.context-foundry/patterns/` in the GitHub repository.

**Q: What if I share a bad pattern?**
A: The validation catches most issues. If a bad pattern makes it through, submit a fix PR.

**Q: Can I delete a pattern I shared?**
A: Yes, submit a PR removing it from `.context-foundry/patterns/*.json`

**Q: How do I know my patterns helped someone?**
A: Future build feedback will reference patterns that prevented issues!
