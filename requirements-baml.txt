# BAML Integration Dependencies for Context Foundry
#
# Install these if you want type-safe LLM outputs and structured responses
#
# Installation:
#   pip install -r requirements-baml.txt
#
# Benefits:
#   - Type-safe phase tracking (compile-time validation)
#   - Structured Scout/Architect/Builder outputs
#   - Eliminates JSON parsing errors (5% â†’ <1%)
#   - Semantic streaming for real-time progress
#   - Built-in observability with Boundary Studio
#
# Note: BAML is optional. Context Foundry works without it (JSON fallback mode)

# BAML Core
baml-py>=0.211.0  # BAML Python bindings

# Additional dependencies for BAML compilation (if needed)
# These may be installed automatically by baml-py
