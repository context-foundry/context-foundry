# Context Foundry TODO - 2025-10-05

## Current Issue: Weather App Search Not Working

### Problem
- Weather app loads but search button does nothing
- Recent searches display (houston, los angeles, toledo) but clicking them doesn't show weather
- No API calls being made when searching

### Root Cause
Builder (gpt-4o-mini) generated **placeholder/stub code** instead of working implementations:

1. **Incomplete function** (`frontend/app.js:32-35`):
   ```javascript
   function performSearch(search) {
       // Perform the weather search logic here (API call, etc.)  ← PLACEHOLDER!
       saveSearchToLocal(search);
   }
   ```
   No actual API call or weather display logic!

2. **Missing file**: Tasks.md specified creating `js/weather-api.js` but file doesn't exist

3. **Wrong paths**: Files created in `frontend/` instead of `js/` as task specified

### Impact
This is a **critical quality issue** - users get non-functional apps that look complete but don't work.

## Fixes Already Implemented Today ✅

### 1. npm Command Detection
- **File**: `tools/cli.py:326` and `workflows/autonomous_orchestrator.py:1805`
- **Fix**: Read package.json to detect correct npm command
- **Result**: Shows `npm start` for CRA, `npm run dev` for Vite

### 2. Path Resolution (FOUNDRY_ROOT)
- **File**: `workflows/autonomous_orchestrator.py:17-18, 67, 69-70, 265, 451`
- **Fix**: Use `FOUNDRY_ROOT` constant for all paths
- **Result**: Works from any directory, no more Trash folder issues

### 3. CRA Structure Requirements
- **File**: `workflows/autonomous_orchestrator.py:738-772`
- **Fix**: Added builder prompt section with:
  - public/index.html template
  - react-scripts dependency requirement
  - Common CRA files (index.css, App.css)
- **Result**: Creates proper CRA structure

### 4. CSS Import Validation
- **File**: `workflows/autonomous_orchestrator.py:1445-1447`
- **Fix**: Check file extension before adding .js (was looking for `index.css.js`)
- **Result**: Properly detects missing CSS files

### 5. Absolute Project Paths
- **File**: `workflows/autonomous_orchestrator.py:67, 69-70`
- **Fix**: Use `FOUNDRY_ROOT / "examples" / project_name`
- **Result**: Projects always created in correct location

### 6. CRA File Path Requirements (Architect)
- **File**: `workflows/autonomous_orchestrator.py:466-484`
- **Fix**: Added requirements for full paths (`src/components/*.js`)
- **Result**: Architect generates correct full paths for CRA

### 7. JSON Import Shadowing
- **File**: `workflows/autonomous_orchestrator.py` (5 locations)
- **Fix**: Removed all local `import json` statements
- **Result**: No more UnboundLocalError

## TODO: Fix Placeholder Code Issue

### Option 1: Add Placeholder Detection (Recommended)
**Location**: `workflows/autonomous_orchestrator.py` - Add to validation section

**Implementation**:
```python
def _detect_placeholder_code(self, all_files: List[str]) -> Dict[str, List[str]]:
    """Detect placeholder/stub code in generated files."""
    issues = []

    placeholder_patterns = [
        r'//\s*(TODO|FIXME|IMPLEMENT|ADD LOGIC|PERFORM THE)',
        r'#\s*(TODO|FIXME|IMPLEMENT)',
        r'/\*\s*(TODO|FIXME)',
        r'console\.log\(["\']Not implemented',
        r'raise NotImplementedError',
        r'pass\s*#.*implement',
    ]

    for file_path in all_files:
        if not file_path.endswith(('.js', '.py', '.ts', '.jsx', '.tsx')):
            continue

        file_full_path = self.project_dir / file_path
        if not file_full_path.exists():
            continue

        try:
            content = file_full_path.read_text()
            for pattern in placeholder_patterns:
                matches = re.findall(pattern, content, re.IGNORECASE)
                if matches:
                    issues.append(f"{file_path} contains placeholder code: {matches[0]}")
        except:
            pass

    return {"issues": issues}
```

**Call from**: `_run_builder_for_tasks()` after file creation, before final validation

### Option 2: Strengthen Builder Prompt
**Location**: `workflows/autonomous_orchestrator.py:700-702`

**Add after "DO:" section**:
```
⚠️  CRITICAL - NO PLACEHOLDER CODE:
□ NEVER use TODO comments or placeholder logic
□ NEVER use comments like "// Implement this", "// Add logic here", "// Perform the..."
□ Every function MUST have complete working implementation
□ API calls must use actual fetch/axios with real endpoints
□ Example of WRONG code:
  function performSearch(city) {
      // TODO: Fetch weather data  ❌ NEVER DO THIS
  }
□ Example of CORRECT code:
  async function performSearch(city) {
      const response = await fetch(`https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${city}&appid=${API_KEY}`);
      const data = await response.json();
      displayWeather(data);
  }
```

### Option 3: Both (Recommended)
Implement both Option 1 (detection) and Option 2 (prevention) for defense in depth.

## Additional Issues to Investigate

### File Path Mismatch
- Tasks.md says create `js/weather-api.js`
- Builder created `frontend/app.js` instead
- Why is builder ignoring task file paths?
- **Check**: Builder file path extraction logic

### Project Type Detection
- README says "Static HTML" but has mixed structure (frontend/, src/)
- Should clarify detection logic
- **Check**: `_generate_readme()` project type detection

---

## Testing Checklist

After implementing placeholder detection:

- [ ] Build new weather app with foundry
- [ ] Verify no placeholder comments in generated code
- [ ] Check that search functionality works
- [ ] Confirm API calls are made
- [ ] Verify weather data displays correctly
- [ ] Test with both gpt-4o-mini and other models

---

## Notes

- gpt-4o-mini tends to generate stub code more than claude models
- May need to switch to stronger model for builder phase
- Or add explicit validation that fails build if placeholders detected
- Consider adding "smoke test" that actually runs the code and checks for basic functionality

## Future Enhancements

### Git as Memory System

**Concept**: Treat agent knowledge evolution as git history, not just timestamped snapshots.

**Current State**:
- `.context-foundry/history/` stores timestamped blueprint snapshots
- Difficult to diff between sessions (files have timestamps in names)
- Can't trace when specific ideas/decisions appeared
- Can't branch/merge knowledge exploration
- Manual cleanup needed (history folder grows forever)

**Proposed Enhancement**:
Commit `.context-foundry/` files to git after each agent phase, making knowledge evolution transparent and auditable.

**Benefits**:
1. ✅ `git log .context-foundry/` shows complete knowledge timeline
2. ✅ `git blame .context-foundry/PLAN.md` traces when decisions were made
3. ✅ `git diff session-1..session-5` compares how understanding evolved
4. ✅ `git branch` to explore alternative architectural approaches
5. ✅ `git checkout HEAD~10` to reconstruct what agent knew at any point
6. ✅ Standard tooling (gitk, tig, GitHub) works out of the box
7. ✅ Human-readable and transparent - anyone can audit agent reasoning

**Implementation Ideas**:

**Option 1: Commit after each agent phase (Recommended)**
```bash
# After Scout
git add .context-foundry/RESEARCH.md
git commit -m "scout: Research weather app architecture

- Identified OpenWeatherMap API
- Designed component structure
- Context: 25%"

# After Architect
git add .context-foundry/{SPEC,PLAN,TASKS}.md
git commit -m "architect: Created implementation plan

- 6 tasks identified
- CRA architecture chosen
- Estimated 2hr build time"

# After Builder Task 1
git add .context-foundry/PROGRESS.md src/components/
git commit -m "builder(task-1): Created Header component

- Files: src/components/Header.js
- Tests: 5/5 passing
- Context: 30%"
```

**Option 2: Separate git repo for knowledge**
```
project-name/
├── .git/              ← Project code commits
└── .context-foundry/
    ├── .git/          ← Agent knowledge commits (separate repo)
    ├── RESEARCH.md
    └── ...
```

**Option 3: Git notes (lightweight)**
```bash
# Attach knowledge metadata to project commits
git notes add -m "Agent context: 45%
Scout identified: OpenWeatherMap API
Architect planned: 6-task breakdown"
```

**Challenges**:
- Merge conflicts if multiple agents update same blueprint
- Commit granularity (every API call vs. batched by task?)
- Repo bloat with many .context-foundry/ commits
- Need to teach agents git commands

**Use Cases**:
```bash
# When did agent decide to use Redux?
git log -S "Redux" .context-foundry/

# What was the agent's plan 2 weeks ago?
git show HEAD~20:.context-foundry/PLAN.md

# How did the architecture decision change?
git diff v1.0..v2.0 .context-foundry/

# Explore alternative approaches
git checkout -b explore-graphql
# ... architect runs with GraphQL instead of REST
git diff main .context-foundry/PLAN.md
```

**Recommended Approach**:
- Start simple: Commit `.context-foundry/` after each major phase (Scout/Architect/Builder)
- Use conventional commits: `scout:`, `architect:`, `builder(task-N):`
- Store in same git repo as project (not separate)
- Add `.context-foundry/.git` to `.gitignore` if using Option 2

**Related Tools**:
- Could build web UI showing knowledge evolution timeline
- Integration with GitHub/GitLab for collaborative agent memory
- Export git history as "reasoning trace" for transparency
- Use git bisect to find when a bad decision was introduced

**Priority**: Medium (nice to have, not critical for core functionality)

**Effort**: ~2-3 days to implement basic version with commit hooks
