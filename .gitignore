# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# Private Extensions (user-specific, not for public repo)
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# The extensions/ directory contains modular, user-specific
# enhancements that teach Context Foundry specialized skills.
#
# CURRENT EXTENSIONS:
#
# 📊 extensions/flowise/ - Flowise Agent Flow Specialization
#    - Enables Context Foundry to build production-ready Flowise
#      multi-agent workflows from single-sentence prompts
#    - Includes authoritative pattern reference (AGENT_PATTERN_REFERENCE.md)
#    - Contains 13+ canonical Flowise flow templates
#    - Validates against real Flowise export structure
#    - Produces perfect, import-ready JSON on first build
#
#    Example: "Build warehouse operations flow with Workday integration"
#    Result: Complete 9-agent system with routing, tools, knowledge sources
#
# WHY GITIGNORED:
# - User-specific customizations (templates, patterns, configs)
# - May contain proprietary flow designs
# - Allows each user to maintain their own extension library
# - Prevents merge conflicts from personalized extensions
#
# HOW TO PRESERVE:
# - Extensions are LOCAL to your machine (not pushed to GitHub)
# - This branch (enhancement/flowise-agent-builder) preserves
#   the orchestrator_prompt.txt integration that references them
# - To share: manually copy extensions/ to another user's clone
