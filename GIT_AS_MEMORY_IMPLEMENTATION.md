# Git as Memory - Implementation Complete

## What Was Implemented

The Git as Memory system tracks agent reasoning and decisions in git history for transparency and auditability.

### Changes Made

**File**: `workflows/autonomous_orchestrator.py`

1. **New Method**: `_commit_agent_memory()` (lines 1663-1712)
   - Commits `.context-foundry/` files only (not code)
   - Takes phase, message, and optional details
   - Gracefully handles non-git projects
   - Changes to project directory before committing

2. **Scout Phase** (after line 430)
   - Commits RESEARCH.md after Scout completes
   - Commit message: `scout: Research {project_name}`
   - Includes mode, tokens, and model in commit body

3. **Architect Phase** (after line 582)
   - Commits SPEC.md, PLAN.md, TASKS.md after Architect completes
   - Commit message: `architect: Created implementation plan for {project_name}`
   - Includes task count, tokens, and model in commit body

4. **Builder Phase** (after line 892)
   - Commits after EACH task completes
   - Commit message: `builder(task-N): {task_name}`
   - Includes files created (first 5), tokens, and model
   - **Separate from code commits** - agent memory in its own commit

## How to Test

### Manual Testing

1. **Create a git-initialized project**:
   ```bash
   mkdir test-project
   cd test-project
   git init
   ```

2. **Run foundry build**:
   ```bash
   foundry build test-project "simple todo app"
   # Follow prompts to complete build
   ```

3. **Verify git commits were created**:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline
   # Should show commits like:
   # abc123 builder(task-3): Add CSS styling
   # def456 builder(task-2): Create todo list component
   # ghi789 builder(task-1): Set up project structure
   # jkl012 architect: Created implementation plan for test-project
   # mno345 scout: Research test-project
   ```

4. **View agent memory commits only**:
   ```bash
   git log --grep="scout:\|architect:\|builder" --oneline
   ```

5. **See what agent knew at specific point**:
   ```bash
   git show abc123:.context-foundry/PLAN.md
   ```

6. **Trace when a decision was made**:
   ```bash
   git blame .context-foundry/PLAN.md
   ```

7. **Compare knowledge evolution**:
   ```bash
   git diff ghi789..abc123 .context-foundry/
   ```

### Expected Behavior

**For projects WITH git**:
- ‚úÖ Creates separate commits for `.context-foundry/` after each phase
- ‚úÖ Commits include phase name, summary, and details
- ‚úÖ Does not fail build if commit fails
- ‚úÖ Prints "üìç Agent memory committed to git (phase)"

**For projects WITHOUT git**:
- ‚úÖ Silently skips git commits
- ‚úÖ Build continues normally
- ‚úÖ No error messages

## Git History Example

After building a weather app, `git log` might show:

```
fc3cc85 builder(task-5): Implement local storage
- Files: 2 created
- Tokens: 1234
- Model: gpt-4o-mini
  - src/utils/localStorage.js
  - src/utils/localStorage.test.js

abc1234 builder(task-4): Add error handling
- Files: 3 created
- Tokens: 987
- Model: gpt-4o-mini
  - src/components/ErrorBoundary.js
  - src/components/ErrorMessage.js
  - src/components/ErrorMessage.test.js

def5678 builder(task-3): Create weather display
- Files: 4 created
- Tokens: 1567
- Model: gpt-4o-mini
  - src/components/WeatherCard.js
  - src/components/WeatherCard.css
  - src/components/WeatherCard.test.js
  - src/components/Forecast.js

ghi9012 architect: Created implementation plan for weather-app
- 5 tasks identified
- Tokens: 2345
- Model: gpt-4o-mini

jkl3456 scout: Research weather-app
- Mode: new
- Tokens: 1789
- Model: gpt-4o-mini
```

## Benefits Realized

1. **Transparency**: Anyone can see how agent reasoning evolved
2. **Auditability**: `git blame` shows when/why decisions were made
3. **Time Travel**: `git checkout` to see agent knowledge at any point
4. **Comparison**: `git diff` to see how plans changed
5. **Debugging**: Trace when bad decisions were introduced
6. **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can review agent reasoning

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add git branch creation for exploring alternative approaches
- [ ] Build web UI to visualize knowledge evolution timeline
- [ ] Export git history as "reasoning trace" for transparency reports
- [ ] Use `git bisect` to find when issues were introduced
- [ ] Integration with GitHub/GitLab for collaborative agent memory

## Branch Information

- **Branch**: `feature/git-as-memory`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Implementation complete, ready for manual testing
- **PR**: Can create PR to merge into main once tested

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Build a simple HTML app in git repo
- [ ] Verify scout/architect/builder commits created
- [ ] Check commit messages are properly formatted
- [ ] Test in non-git directory (should skip gracefully)
- [ ] Verify `.context-foundry/` files in commits
- [ ] Verify code files NOT in memory commits
- [ ] Test with different project types (React, Python, etc.)
