## Architecture & Design Decisions

**Test-Driven Development (TDD) Approach**: Task 13 implementing performance optimization using TDD methodology - comprehensive tests written first, then implementation follows. All tests are executable and provide real performance metrics.

**Multi-Layered Performance Strategy**: 
- Request-level optimization (debouncing, deduplication)
- Resource-level optimization (image optimization, lazy loading)  
- Caching strategy (service workers, intelligent cache with TTL)
- Component lifecycle management (lazy loading, memory cleanup)

**Performance Testing Framework**: Custom-built performance test runner with real-time metrics tracking (load time, API calls, cache hits, image loads) and comprehensive test coverage for all optimization features.

## Patterns & Best Practices

**Debouncing Pattern**: Implemented with immediate execution option, cancel/flush methods for fine-grained control over function execution timing.

**Request Deduplication Pattern**: Map-based pending request tracking to prevent duplicate concurrent API calls, with automatic cleanup on resolution/rejection.

**Smart Caching Pattern**: LRU eviction with TTL support, size limits, and automatic cleanup intervals. Includes comprehensive statistics tracking.

**Lazy Loading Pattern**: Component-based lazy loading using Intersection Observer API for viewport-based loading triggers.

**Performance Monitoring**: Real-time metrics collection with mock API integration for testing, including stress testing capabilities.

## Current Context

**Currently Implementing**: Task 13 of 14 - Performance Optimization phase
**Immediate Focus**: Building comprehensive performance utilities and testing framework
**Next Steps**: Complete implementation of image optimization utilities, service worker implementation, and component lazy loading system

**Files Being Created**:
- `tests/test-performance.html` - Comprehensive performance testing suite (COMPLETE)
- `js/utils/performance.js` - Core performance utilities (IN PROGRESS - partially complete with debounce, throttle, RequestDeduplicator, SmartCache)

## Progress Summary

**Completed**:
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive performance testing framework with 15+ test cases
- ‚úÖ Real-time performance metrics tracking system
- ‚úÖ Debounce/throttle utilities with advanced features
- ‚úÖ Request deduplication system for preventing duplicate API calls
- ‚úÖ Smart caching system with LRU eviction and TTL support
- ‚úÖ Stress testing capabilities for load testing

**In Progress**:
- üîÑ Performance utilities implementation (50% complete - missing image optimization, lazy loader)

**Remaining**:
- ‚è≥ Image optimization utilities (WebP detection, lazy loading, responsive images)
- ‚è≥ Service worker implementation for resource caching
- ‚è≥ Component lazy loading system with Intersection Observer
- ‚è≥ Integration with existing weather service components

## Critical Issues & Learnings

**TDD Implementation Success**: Test-first approach proving effective - tests provide clear specifications and real validation of performance improvements.

**Performance Budget Approach**: Established performance budgets (3s load time, max 10 API calls) with automated testing to enforce limits.

**Memory Management Focus**: Tests specifically check for memory leaks in component lifecycle - destroy methods required for proper cleanup.

**Browser Compatibility**: Using feature detection patterns for modern APIs (Service Worker, Cache API, Intersection Observer) with graceful fallbacks.

**Mock Integration Strategy**: Tests use sophisticated mocking of fetch, Image constructor, and performance APIs for accurate testing without external dependencies.

## Implementation Details

**Debounce Implementation**: Advanced debouncing with immediate execution option, cancel/flush capabilities, and proper context preservation.

**Cache Architecture**: Map-based storage with separate access time tracking for LRU eviction, automatic cleanup intervals, and comprehensive statistics.

**Request Deduplication**: Promise-based deduplication using request keys, with automatic cleanup on resolution/rejection to prevent memory leaks.

**Testing Framework**: Custom performance test runner with assertion methods, timing utilities, and real-time metrics display. Includes both unit tests and stress testing capabilities.

**Performance Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of load time, API calls, cache hits, and image loads with visual dashboard display.

**Next Implementation Phase**: Need to complete image optimization (WebP detection, lazy loading), service worker for resource caching, and component lazy loading system with Intersection Observer integration.
