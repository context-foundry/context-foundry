## Architecture & Design Decisions

**Component-Based Architecture**: Implementing a modular loading/error handling system with separate `LoadingSpinner` and `ErrorMessage` components, each encapsulating their own state, rendering, and lifecycle management.

**Multi-Type Loading System**: LoadingSpinner supports multiple display types (`spinner`, `dots`, `bars`, `pulse`, `progress`, `skeleton`) to match different UX contexts and performance needs.

**Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Comprehensive test suite written first with 20+ test cases covering component instantiation, rendering, customization, accessibility, performance, and integration scenarios.

**Accessibility-First Design**: Built-in ARIA live regions, screen reader announcements, proper role attributes, and keyboard navigation support from the ground up.

**GPU-Accelerated Animations**: Loading indicators designed with CSS transforms and will-change properties for smooth 60fps animations.

## Patterns & Best Practices

**Factory Pattern**: LoadingSpinner acts as factory for different loading indicator types based on configuration.

**Observer Pattern**: Callback system (`onShow`, `onHide`, `onRetry`) for component lifecycle events and user interactions.

**Progressive Enhancement**: Skeleton UI provides instant visual feedback while actual content loads, improving perceived performance.

**Error Recovery Patterns**: Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff, maximum attempt limits, and contextual error messaging based on error types (network, validation, server).

**Memory Management**: Explicit cleanup methods (`destroy()`) to prevent memory leaks from event listeners, timeouts, and animation frames.

**Responsive Design**: Size variants (`small`, `medium`, `large`) and adaptive layouts for different screen sizes and contexts.

## Current Context

**Task 11 of 14**: "Loading States & Error Handling" implementation in progress for weather-web project.

**Current Phase**: Implementing LoadingSpinner component with partial code completion - main class structure and constructor completed, but render methods for different types (`renderSpinner()`, `renderDots()`, `renderSkeleton()`, etc.) are incomplete.

**Immediate Goals**: 
1. Complete all render methods for LoadingSpinner types
2. Implement ErrorMessage component with retry mechanisms  
3. Create comprehensive CSS styling for all variants
4. Ensure all 20+ tests pass

**Files Being Created**:
- `js/components/loadingSpinner.js` (partially complete)
- `js/components/errorMessage.js` (not started)
- `css/components.css` (not started)
- `tests/test-loading-error.html` (complete)

## Progress Summary

**Completed**:
- Comprehensive test suite with 20+ test cases covering all requirements
- LoadingSpinner class foundation with constructor, show/hide methods, progress tracking
- Component lifecycle management (show, hide, destroy)
- Basic state management and options handling
- Test framework with demo controls for visual validation

**In Progress**:
- LoadingSpinner render methods (cut off mid-implementation)
- Need to complete: renderSpinner, renderDots, renderBars, renderPulse, renderProgress, renderSkeleton methods

**Remaining**:
- Complete LoadingSpinner implementation
- ErrorMessage component with retry logic and error type detection
- CSS styling for all component variants and animations
- Integration testing between LoadingSpinner and ErrorMessage

## Critical Issues & Learnings

**Animation Performance**: Must use CSS transforms and GPU acceleration (`will-change: transform`, `backface-visibility: hidden`) to achieve smooth 60fps loading animations, especially for mobile devices.

**Accessibility Requirements**: Loading states must announce changes to screen readers via `aria-live` regions, and error messages need `role="alert"` for immediate notification.

**Error Categorization**: Need smart error detection logic to categorize errors (network: `Failed to fetch`, validation: 404 status, server: 500+ status, rate limiting) for appropriate user messaging and retry strategies.

**Memory Leak Prevention**: Animation frames, timeouts, and event listeners must be properly cleaned up in destroy() method to prevent memory leaks in SPA contexts.

**Skeleton UI Complexity**: Weather-specific skeleton layouts (`weather-card`, `forecast-grid`) require careful DOM structure matching to avoid layout shifts when real content loads.

## Implementation Details

**Component State Management**: Each component maintains internal state (isVisible, currentProgress, animationId) with proper state transitions and guards against invalid operations.

**Animation System**: Custom animation frame handling for smooth transitions, with fallbacks for older browsers and reduced-motion preferences.

**Error Recovery Logic**: Retry mechanisms with configurable max attempts, exponential backoff timing, and context-aware error messages based on error type detection.

**Modular CSS Architecture**: Component-based CSS with BEM naming conventions (`loading-spinner--large`, `error-message--network`) for maintainable styling.

**Performance Optimizations**: Skeleton UI prevents layout shifts, GPU-accelerated animations reduce main-thread blocking, and component pooling could be implemented for frequent show/hide operations.

**Integration Points**: Components designed to work together seamlessly - LoadingSpinner can transition to ErrorMessage on failure, with shared container and consistent UX patterns.
