## Architecture & Design Decisions

**Core Problem Identification**: The weather web application is using a paid OpenWeatherMap endpoint (`https://pro.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather`) that requires subscription authentication, causing the app to hang at "Loading weather data..." when authentication fails.

**Solution Architecture**: Switch to free OpenWeatherMap API (`https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather`) which provides identical response format with no code changes needed. This maintains 100% compatibility while eliminating subscription requirements.

**API Strategy**: Chosen OpenWeatherMap Free over alternatives (WeatherAPI, Open-Meteo, Visual Crossing) because it requires zero response parsing changes - identical JSON structure to current paid version.

**Error Handling Design**: Plan to implement timeout handling (10s), rate limit detection, and graceful degradation for free tier limitations (60 calls/minute, 1000/day).

## Patterns & Best Practices

**Configuration Management Pattern**: Created centralized `FREE_API_CONFIG` object with all endpoint settings, timeouts, and rate limits clearly defined for easy maintenance.

**Request Builder Pattern**: Implemented `FreeAPIRequestBuilder` class to handle URL construction, fetch options, and response validation consistently.

**Error Mapping Pattern**: Established `FREE_API_ERROR_MESSAGES` for user-friendly error translation from HTTP status codes (401, 429, 404) to meaningful messages.

**Testing Strategy Pattern**: Built live compatibility testing tool (`api-compatibility-test.html`) for real-time endpoint verification and response format comparison.

## Current Context

**Current Task**: Task 2 of 7 - Research Free Endpoint Alternative (COMPLETED)

**Phase**: Research and planning phase transitioning to implementation

**Immediate Next Steps**: 
- Task 3: Update endpoint configuration in `weather.js`
- Replace paid URL with free URL
- Implement timeout handling to prevent hanging

**Current Files Ready**: All research documentation and configuration files created, including ready-to-use code snippets for Task 3 implementation.

## Progress Summary

**Completed (Task 2)**:
- ✅ Researched and validated free API alternatives
- ✅ Confirmed OpenWeatherMap Free API endpoint functionality
- ✅ Verified 100% response format compatibility
- ✅ Created comprehensive implementation configurations
- ✅ Built testing tools and migration documentation
- ✅ Established rate limit handling strategy

**Remaining Tasks (3-7)**:
- ⏳ Update API endpoint URL and configuration
- ⏳ Implement timeout handling (10s limit)
- ⏳ Add enhanced error handling for free tier
- ⏳ Improve loading state management
- ⏳ Complete testing and validation

**Key Milestone**: Research phase complete with clear implementation path identified.

## Critical Issues & Learnings

**Root Cause Found**: Application hangs because paid endpoint requires valid subscription, but current implementation has no timeout or error handling for authentication failures.

**Critical Discovery**: Free OpenWeatherMap API returns identical JSON structure to paid version, meaning existing parsing code (`data.name`, `data.main.temp`, `data.weather[0].description`) will work unchanged.

**Rate Limit Awareness**: Free tier has strict limits (60/min, 1000/day) that must be handled gracefully to prevent user frustration.

**Timeout Imperative**: Must implement `AbortSignal.timeout(10000)` to prevent indefinite hanging when API requests fail.

**API Key Management**: Free keys can be exposed client-side (unlike paid keys), simplifying implementation.

## Implementation Details

**URL Migration**: Simple string replacement from `pro.openweathermap.org` to `api.openweathermap.org` in base URL configuration.

**Authentication**: Same `appid` parameter used, but with free API key instead of paid subscription key.

**Timeout Implementation**: Use `fetch()` with `AbortSignal.timeout(10000)` to prevent hanging requests.

**Error Handling Strategy**: 
- Status 401: Invalid API key message
- Status 429: Rate limit exceeded with retry suggestion  
- Status 404: City not found error
- Network errors: Connection issue guidance

**Rate Limit Handling**: Plan client-side tracking of request frequency and user feedback when limits approached.

**Testing Approach**: Created live testing HTML tool that can verify both endpoints and compare response formats in real-time.

**Ready-to-Deploy Configuration**: All configuration objects created with proper structure for immediate implementation in Task 3, including sample URLs and error handling patterns.
