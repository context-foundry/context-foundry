I notice that the conversation content to summarize was not included in your message. You mentioned "CONVERSATION TO SUMMARIZE:" but no actual conversation history follows.

To create the comprehensive summary you need while staying within token limits, please provide the conversation history that needs to be compacted. Once you share that, I'll create a structured summary following your specified format that preserves all critical information in 1500-2500 tokens.

The summary will include:

## Architecture & Design Decisions
[Will extract key architectural choices and rationale from the conversation]

## Patterns & Best Practices  
[Will identify patterns discovered/applied from the discussion]

## Current Context
[Will capture current work phase and immediate goals]

## Progress Summary
[Will document completed work and remaining tasks]

## Critical Issues & Learnings
[Will preserve errors, solutions, and lessons learned]

## Implementation Details
[Will maintain key technical approaches and methods]

Please share the conversation history and I'll provide the comprehensive summary you need.
