I notice that the conversation content to summarize is missing from your request. You've provided the context about token usage (49.2% of 200K tokens, 98,458 total tokens, 8 messages) and clear instructions for creating a summary, but the actual "CONVERSATION TO SUMMARIZE:" section is empty.

To create the comprehensive summary you need, I'll require:

1. The actual conversation history/messages that need to be summarized
2. The specific coding session content that's consuming those 98,458 tokens

Could you please provide the conversation content that needs to be compacted? Once you share that, I'll create a structured summary following your exact format requirements, ensuring all critical information is preserved within the 1500-2500 token target.
