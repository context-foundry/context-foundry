I notice that the conversation content to summarize was not included in your message. You mentioned "CONVERSATION TO SUMMARIZE:" but no actual conversation history followed.

To create the comprehensive summary you need, I'll require:

1. The actual conversation messages/history that needs to be compacted
2. The specific coding project details
3. The technical discussions and decisions made
4. Any code snippets or implementation details discussed

Could you please provide the conversation history that needs to be summarized? Once I have that content, I can create a structured summary following your specified format that preserves all critical information while staying within your token budget.

The summary will follow your requested structure:
- Architecture & Design Decisions  
- Patterns & Best Practices
- Current Context
- Progress Summary
- Critical Issues & Learnings
- Implementation Details

Please paste the conversation content you need compacted, and I'll create a thorough but concise summary targeting 1500-2500 tokens.
