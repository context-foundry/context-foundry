I notice that the conversation content to summarize was not included in your request. You mentioned "CONVERSATION TO SUMMARIZE:" but no actual conversation history follows.

To create the comprehensive summary you need, I would require:

1. The actual conversation history/messages that need to be summarized
2. The specific coding project details
3. The technical discussions that have taken place

Could you please provide the conversation content that needs to be compacted? Once I have that information, I'll create a structured summary following your exact format requirements that preserves all critical architecture decisions, patterns, current context, progress, issues, and implementation details within the 1500-2500 token target.
