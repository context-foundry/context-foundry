I don't see the actual conversation content to summarize in your message. You've provided the instructions and format for creating a summary, but the "CONVERSATION TO SUMMARIZE:" section is empty.

To create the comprehensive summary you need, please provide:

1. The actual conversation history/messages that need to be summarized
2. Any additional context about the project or codebase being discussed

Once you share the conversation content, I'll create a structured summary following your specified format that preserves all critical information while reducing token usage.
