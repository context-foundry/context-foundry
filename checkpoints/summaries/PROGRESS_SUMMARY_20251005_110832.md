## Architecture & Design Decisions

**API Configuration Architecture**: Implemented centralized configuration management with `WeatherConfig` class handling API key validation, URL construction, and error display. Uses multiple loading strategies (server endpoint, environment variables, direct configuration) with graceful fallbacks.

**API Client Layer**: Created robust `WeatherAPIClient` with comprehensive error handling, retry logic with exponential backoff, request deduplication, rate limiting (60 requests/minute), and intelligent caching (5-minute TTL, 50-item LRU). Includes request timeout (10s), cancellation support via AbortController, and standardized error types.

**UI Component Structure**: Modular HTML structure with semantic sections - search form, loading states, weather display with detailed metrics grid, error handling, and debug panel. CSS uses CSS custom properties for theming and responsive grid layouts.

**Error Handling Strategy**: Multi-layered approach with custom `WeatherAPIError` class, user-friendly error messages mapped from API codes, graceful degradation, and comprehensive debug information.

## Patterns & Best Practices

**Configuration Management Pattern**: Singleton configuration with async initialization, validation, and user feedback. Handles placeholder detection and provides setup instructions.

**API Client Patterns**: Promise-based async operations, request queuing to prevent duplicates, cache-first strategy with force refresh options, and comprehensive request lifecycle management.

**UI State Management**: Clear separation between loading, success, and error states with appropriate ARIA labels for accessibility. Event-driven architecture with bound methods to maintain context.

**Error Recovery Pattern**: User-actionable error messages, retry mechanisms, and fallback behaviors. Debug panel for development troubleshooting.

**Responsive Design Pattern**: CSS Grid and Flexbox for adaptive layouts, CSS custom properties for consistent theming, and clamp() functions for fluid typography.

## Current Context

**Current Phase**: Task 4 of 6 - UI Data Display Implementation

**Just Completed**: Comprehensive HTML structure with all required UI components, complete CSS styling system with modern design patterns, and foundational JavaScript structure in main.js (partially implemented).

**Immediate Status**: HTML and CSS are complete and production-ready. The main.js file was being implemented but was cut off mid-implementation during the weather display functionality.

**Next Steps**: Complete the main.js implementation (specifically the remaining parts of the WeatherApp class), integrate all components, and move to Task 5.

## Progress Summary

**Completed Tasks**:
- Task 1: API Configuration Setup (.env, config.js with comprehensive error handling)
- Task 3: API Integration Layer (weather-api.js with full API client implementation)
- Task 4: UI Structure and Styling (index.html, style.css - complete)

**Current Implementation Status**:
- Configuration layer: âœ… Complete with validation and testing
- API client: âœ… Complete with caching, rate limiting, retry logic
- HTML structure: âœ… Complete with accessibility features
- CSS styling: âœ… Complete with responsive design
- Main application logic: ðŸ”„ In progress (cut off during implementation)

**Remaining Tasks**: Tasks 5-6 plus completion of main.js integration

## Critical Issues & Learnings

**API Key Security**: Implemented multiple loading strategies but emphasized never committing real API keys. Provides clear setup instructions and placeholder detection.

**Rate Limiting**: OpenWeatherMap has 60 calls/minute limit - implemented client-side rate limiting with request tracking and automatic throttling.

**Error User Experience**: Mapped technical API errors to user-friendly messages. Critical to handle common scenarios like city not found, network issues, and API key problems.

**Cache Strategy**: 5-minute cache prevents unnecessary API calls and improves performance. Implemented LRU eviction and cache size limits.

**Request Management**: AbortController prevents race conditions and allows request cancellation. Request deduplication prevents multiple simultaneous calls for same city.

**Accessibility Considerations**: ARIA labels, semantic HTML, keyboard navigation support, and screen reader compatibility throughout UI components.

## Implementation Details

**API Client Features**: 
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff (3 attempts max)
- Request timeout (10 seconds)
- Response transformation to consistent data structure
- Comprehensive error categorization and handling
- Built-in debugging and metrics collection

**UI Architecture**:
- Grid-based responsive layout with CSS custom properties
- Component-based styling with reusable patterns
- Loading states with animated indicators
- Detailed weather information display with icons and metrics
- Debug panel for development monitoring

**Data Flow**: Search form â†’ API client â†’ data transformation â†’ UI update with comprehensive error handling at each step.

**Caching Strategy**: In-memory cache with timestamp-based expiration, size limits, and cache hit tracking for performance monitoring.

**Performance Optimizations**: Request deduplication, intelligent caching, lazy loading of optional features, and minimal DOM manipulation patterns.
