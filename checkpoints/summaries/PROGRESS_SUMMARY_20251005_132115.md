I notice that the conversation content to summarize was not included in your message. You mentioned "CONVERSATION TO SUMMARIZE:" but no actual conversation history follows.

To create the comprehensive summary you need, I would require:

1. The actual conversation messages/history that needs to be compacted
2. The specific coding project details
3. The technical discussions that have taken place

Could you please provide the conversation content that needs to be summarized? Once I have that information, I'll create a thorough structured summary following your specified format that preserves all critical:

- Architecture decisions
- Patterns and best practices  
- Current task context
- Progress made
- Critical errors/learnings
- Implementation approaches

The summary will be properly structured with the sections you outlined and targeted at 1500-2500 tokens to help you stay within your 200K token window while preserving all essential information for continuing the coding session.
