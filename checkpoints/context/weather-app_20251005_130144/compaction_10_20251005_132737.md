## Summary
I notice that the conversation content to be summarized was not included in your message. You've provided the context about needing to compact 527,152 tokens from 16 messages down to stay within the 200K token limit, but the actual conversation history that needs to be summarized is missing.

To create the comprehensive summary you need, please provide:

1. The full conversation history (all 16 messages)
2. The list of 31 critical items that have been preserved
3. Any specific technical context about the coding session

Once you share the conversation content, I'll create a structured summary following your exact format requirements:

## Architecture & Design Decisions
## Patterns & Best Practices  
## Current Context
## Progress Summary
## Critical Issues & Learnings
## Implementation Details

The summary will be thorough but concise (1500-2500 tokens) and preserve all critical information needed to continue the coding session without losing context.

Please paste the conversation history you need summarized.

## Content Retained
- Total items: 32
- By type: code: 18, decision: 4, summary: 10
