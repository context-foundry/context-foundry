## Summary
I notice that the conversation content to summarize was not included in your message. You mentioned "CONVERSATION TO SUMMARIZE:" but no actual conversation history follows.

To create the comprehensive summary you need while staying within token limits, please provide the conversation history that needs to be compacted. Once you share that, I'll create a structured summary following your specified format that preserves all critical information in 1500-2500 tokens.
