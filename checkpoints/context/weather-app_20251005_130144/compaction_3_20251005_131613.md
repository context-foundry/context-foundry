- **Reduction**: 37,575 tokens (24.5%)

## Summary
## Architecture & Design Decisions
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Implementing Task 7 of 15 for a weather-app using modular JavaScript components with ES6 imports/exports
- **Settings Management**: Centralized settings system with categories (UNITS, APPEARANCE, LOCATION, NOTIFICATIONS, DATA) and real-time validation
- **State Management Integration**: Settings panel subscribes to centralized app state (`AppState.js`) with change detection and source tracking to prevent circular updates
- **Modal/Dialog Pattern**: Settings panel as modal overlay with focus trapping, keyboard navigation, and accessibility features (ARIA attributes, role definitions)
- **Format Utilities**: Separate formatting layer (`format.js`) for unit conversions supporting metric/imperial systems across temperature, wind speed, pressure, and distance

## Patterns & Best Practices
- **Observer Pattern**: State subscription system with unsubscribe cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- **Builder Pattern**: DOM creation through dedicated methods (`createHeader()`, `createNavigation()`, etc.) for maintainability
- **Validation Strategy**: Multi-layer validation with real-time feedback and batch validation on save
- **Event Delegation**: Single event listener on content container handling all form changes
- **Focus Management**: Focus trap implementation for modal accessibility with keyboard navigation
- **Configuration Objects**: Extensive use of configuration constants for options, themes, languages, and unit types
- **Error Boundary**: Try-catch blocks with user-friendly error messages and debug logging

## Current Context
**Currently implementing**: Complete SettingsPanel.js component with unit conversion and settings management capabilities
**Immediate goal**: Finish the SettingsPanel class implementation - the code was cut off mid-method in `handleClearData()`
**Next steps**: Complete the remaining SettingsPanel methods, then implement the companion `format.js` utility file for unit conversions and formatting
**Task scope**: Files required are `js/components/SettingsPanel.js` and `js/utils/format.js`

## Progress Summary
**Completed**:
- Full SettingsPanel class structure with constructor and initialization
- DOM creation methods for all UI sections (header, navigation, content, footer)
- Category rendering for all 5 settings categories (units, appearance, location, notifications, data)
- Form control creation methods (radio, select, toggle, unit sections)
- Event handling system with delegation and keyboard support
- State management integration with subscription/unsubscription
- Settings validation framework structure

**Remaining**:
- Complete final methods in SettingsPanel.js (handleClearData, validation helpers, utility methods)
- Implement complete `format.js` utility with all unit conversion functions
- Test file creation for both components

## Critical Issues & Learnings
- **Focus Management**: Modal dialogs require careful focus trapping to meet accessibility standards
- **State Synchronization**: Settings changes must track source to prevent infinite update loops between components
- **Validation Strategy**: Real-time validation for UX but batch validation before save to ensure data integrity
- **Memory Management**: Event listeners and state subscriptions need proper cleanup in component lifecycle
- **Unit Preview**: Settings changes should show immediate preview without applying globally until save
- **Configuration Complexity**: Large settings objects require careful organization and default value management

## Implementation Details
- **Settings Structure**: Nested object with category-based organization and type-specific validation
- **Unit Conversion**: Support for metric/imperial with preview functionality using format utilities
- **Theme System**: Auto/light/dark themes with real-time preview capability
- **Localization Ready**: Language selection infrastructure with flag icons and locale codes
- **Accessibility**: Full ARIA implementation with role definitions, tab management, and screen reader support
- **Data Management**: Cache control, offline mode, and data usage tracking with clear data functionality
- **Notification System**: Granular notification preferences with conditional UI rendering
- **Input Handling**: Type-aware value extraction (checkbox, radio, number, text) with proper event delegation
