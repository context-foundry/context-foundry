## Summary
## Architecture & Design Decisions

**Component-Based Architecture**: Established a modular frontend architecture with separate service layers, utility modules, and component classes. The WeatherCard component follows a class-based pattern with dependency injection for callbacks and configuration.

**API Service Layer Design**: Implemented a robust three-tier API architecture:
- `config.js`: Centralized configuration with environment detection and feature flags
- `api.js`: Generic HTTP utilities with retry logic, rate limiting, and caching
- `WeatherAPI.js`: Weather-specific service layer (partially implemented)

**Error Handling Strategy**: Comprehensive error handling with custom APIError class, status-code-specific messages, and graceful degradation. Implemented retry mechanisms with exponential backoff.

**Caching Strategy**: LRU cache implementation with TTL support, automatic cleanup, and configurable cache sizes. Different TTL values for weather data (15min) vs geocoding (24hr).

**Responsive Design System**: CSS custom properties-based theming with automatic dark mode detection and manual theme toggle support. Comprehensive design token system for colors, typography, spacing, and shadows.

## Patterns & Best Practices

**Configuration Management**: Centralized configuration with environment detection, feature flags, and performance monitoring toggles. Separates API keys, endpoints, and business logic.

**Error Boundary Pattern**: Layered error handling from network level to UI level with appropriate user messaging and recovery options.

**Loading States & Skeleton UI**: Implemented loading skeletons and progressive disclosure patterns for better perceived performance.

**Accessibility First**: ARIA labels, semantic HTML, focus management, skip links, and keyboard navigation support throughout components.

**Rate Limiting**: Client-side rate limiting to prevent API abuse with request tracking and retry-after calculations.

## Current Context

**Current Phase**: Implementing Task 4 - Weather Card Component display functionality. The core display component is nearly complete with comprehensive weather data visualization capabilities.

**Immediate Context**: Working on the WeatherCard component that handles current weather display with:
- Dynamic weather icon generation (SVG-based)
- Real-time data updates with proper state management  
- Interactive elements (favorites, location clicks)
- Comprehensive weather details display

**Next Steps**: Need to complete the WeatherAPI service layer transformation methods and integrate the components with the main application controller.

## Progress Summary

**Completed**:
- ‚úÖ HTML foundation with semantic structure and accessibility features
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive CSS framework with design system
- ‚úÖ Configuration management system with environment detection
- ‚úÖ HTTP utilities with caching, retries, and error handling
- ‚úÖ WeatherCard component structure with SVG icon generation
- ‚úÖ Loading/error state management
- ‚úÖ Theme system with dark/light mode support

**In Progress**:
- üîÑ WeatherCard component completion (90% done, missing cleanup methods)
- üîÑ WeatherAPI service data transformation layer

**Remaining**:
- ‚ùå Search functionality and location services
- ‚ùå Forecast display components
- ‚ùå Data persistence and favorites management
- ‚ùå Main application controller integration

## Critical Issues & Learnings

**API Key Security**: Using placeholder API key in config - needs proper environment variable implementation for production.

**Memory Management**: Implemented proper cleanup patterns with interval clearing and event listener removal to prevent memory leaks.

**Performance Considerations**: 
- Debounced search inputs to prevent API spam
- Cached responses with intelligent TTL
- Lazy loading patterns for non-critical features

**Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Used modern CSS with fallbacks, avoided cutting-edge JS features for broader support.

**State Management**: Component-level state management without external libraries, using callbacks for parent-child communication.

## Implementation Details

**SVG Icon System**: Dynamic SVG generation for weather icons with proper styling and accessibility. Each weather condition has a custom SVG with appropriate colors and animations.

**Data Transformation**: Standardized weather data format across different API responses with unit conversion and localization support.

**Caching Implementation**: LRU cache with Map-based storage, automatic expiration, and performance monitoring. Supports different TTL values per data type.

**Event-Driven Architecture**: Component communication through callback patterns and event delegation for better performance and maintainability.

**CSS Architecture**: BEM-inspired naming with CSS custom properties for theming. Mobile-first responsive design with progressive enhancement.

**Error Recovery**: Multi-level error handling with user-friendly messages, retry mechanisms, and offline state detection.

The foundation is solid with robust error handling, comprehensive theming, and good architectural patterns. The main challenge ahead is integrating all components and completing the data flow between API services and UI components.
