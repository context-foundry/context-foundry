## Summary
I notice that the conversation content to summarize is missing from your request. You've provided the context about needing to compact from 170,472 tokens (85.2% usage) and the structure for the summary, but the actual conversation history that needs to be summarized is not included.

Could you please provide the conversation content that needs to be summarized? Once you share the actual messages/conversation history, I'll create a comprehensive summary following the exact format you've specified, ensuring all critical information is preserved within the 1500-2500 token target.
