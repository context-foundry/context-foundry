## Summary
## Architecture & Design Decisions

**Component-Based Architecture**: Established a modular system with separate WeatherCard and ForecastGrid components, each handling their own state, rendering, and lifecycle. Components are designed as ES6 classes with clear separation of concerns.

**Service Layer Pattern**: Implemented WeatherService for API integration and WeatherIconService for icon management, following dependency injection principles. Services handle caching, error handling, and data transformation independently from UI components.

**Configuration Management**: Centralized configuration in `js/config.js` with environment detection, API key management, and validation. Supports development/production modes with appropriate fallbacks.

**CSS Custom Properties System**: Extensive use of CSS variables for theming, temperature color coding, and responsive design. Seven-tier temperature classification system (freezing to scorching) with corresponding color schemes and gradients.

**Test-Driven Development**: Comprehensive test suites written first for each component, service, and utility function. Tests cover functionality, edge cases, accessibility, and visual validation.

## Patterns & Best Practices

**Error Handling Strategy**: Multi-layered approach with graceful degradation - API failures fall back to cached data, icon loading failures fall back to SVG then emoji alternatives. All errors are user-friendly with retry mechanisms.

**Performance Optimization**: Implemented caching at multiple levels (API responses, icon loading, DOM elements), lazy loading for icons, throttling/debouncing for user interactions, and intersection observers for performance monitoring.

**Accessibility First**: ARIA labels, semantic HTML, screen reader announcements, keyboard navigation support, high contrast mode compatibility, and reduced motion preferences respect.

**Temperature Color Coding**: Dynamic color assignment based on temperature ranges with CSS custom properties, supporting both Celsius and Fahrenheit with smooth transitions and theme integration.

**Icon Integration Strategy**: OpenWeatherMap API icons with SVG fallbacks and emoji ultimate fallbacks. Lazy loading, caching, error handling, and performance metrics tracking.

## Current Context

**Current Phase**: Working on Task 5 - Weather Icons Integration. Successfully implemented WeatherIconService with comprehensive fallback system and integrated with existing WeatherCard and ForecastGrid components.

**Immediate Goals**: Complete icon integration testing, ensure all fallback scenarios work correctly, optimize icon loading performance, and validate accessibility compliance.

**Next Steps**: Move to Task 6 which involves additional component development or UI enhancements (specifics depend on project requirements).

**Current Focus Areas**:
- Icon loading performance optimization
- SVG fallback completeness for all weather conditions
- Integration testing between components and services
- Visual consistency across different icon states

## Progress Summary

**Completed Tasks**:
- Task 2: Weather Service API Integration - Complete with rate limiting, caching, error handling
- Task 3: Core Weather Components - WeatherCard and ForecastGrid with full functionality
- Task 4: Temperature Color Coding - CSS custom properties system with dynamic theming
- Task 5: Weather Icons Integration - In progress with service implementation complete

**Key Milestones Achieved**:
- Robust API integration with OpenWeatherMap
- Component architecture established
- Comprehensive testing framework in place  
- Accessibility standards implemented
- Performance optimization strategies deployed

**Remaining Work**: 9 more tasks (Tasks 6-14) - likely including additional UI components, advanced features, mobile responsiveness, deployment configuration, and final integration testing.

## Critical Issues & Learnings

**API Key Management**: Implemented secure API key handling with environment detection and validation. Development mode allows demo functionality without real keys.

**Cross-Origin Resource Sharing**: Handled CORS issues with OpenWeatherMap API and icon resources through proper error handling and fallback mechanisms.

**Icon Loading Race Conditions**: Resolved concurrent icon loading issues by implementing promise-based loading with caching and deduplication.

**Temperature Unit Conversion**: Ensured accurate temperature conversions between Celsius/Fahrenheit and proper handling of Kelvin from API responses.

**CSS Custom Property Browser Support**: Implemented fallbacks for older browsers while maintaining modern functionality for supported browsers.

**Performance Bottlenecks**: Identified and resolved issues with excessive API calls through intelligent caching and request deduplication.

## Implementation Details

**Caching Strategy**: Multi-layered caching with Map-based storage for API responses (10-minute TTL) and icon resources (30-minute TTL). Cache invalidation based on timestamps and user preferences.

**Color Algorithm**: Temperature ranges mapped to specific color values with smooth transitions. Seven-tier classification system with corresponding CSS custom properties and gradient support.

**Icon Loading Pipeline**: Progressive loading strategy - OpenWeatherMap PNG → SVG fallback → emoji fallback. Implements retry logic, timeout handling, and performance metrics.

**Component State Management**: Each component manages its own state with methods for loading, error, and success states. Event-driven updates with custom events for cross-component communication.

**Responsive Design Foundation**: CSS Grid and Flexbox layouts with mobile-first approach. Breakpoint system defined in CSS custom properties for consistency.

**Error Recovery Mechanisms**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff, graceful fallbacks at every level, user-friendly error messages with actionable retry options.

**TypeScript-Style Documentation**: Comprehensive JSDoc annotations providing type hints, parameter validation, and usage examples throughout the codebase.
