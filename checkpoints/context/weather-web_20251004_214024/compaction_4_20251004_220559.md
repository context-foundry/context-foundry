## Summary
## Architecture & Design Decisions

**Accessibility-First Implementation**: Implementing Task 12 of 14 for weather-web project using Test-Driven Development approach. Built comprehensive accessibility layer with semantic HTML5, ARIA landmarks, and proper role attributes.

**Multi-Layer Accessibility Strategy**:
- Semantic HTML foundation (header[role="banner"], main[role="main"], nav[role="navigation"])
- ARIA enhancements for complex widgets (combobox for search, live regions for dynamic content)
- Screen reader optimization with descriptive labels and announcements
- Keyboard navigation support with proper focus management
- High contrast support for visual accessibility

**Component Structure**: Weather app with header, search section, current weather display, 5-day forecast, and accessibility utilities (live regions, focus traps, skip links).

## Patterns & Best Practices

**Test-Driven Development**: Created comprehensive test suite first (`test-accessibility.html`) with custom `AccessibilityTestRunner` class covering ARIA compliance, keyboard navigation, screen reader optimization, and high contrast support.

**Accessibility Testing Patterns**:
- Automated ARIA attribute validation
- Keyboard navigation simulation
- Screen reader announcement monitoring
- Focus management verification
- Color-contrast independence testing

**ARIA Implementation Patterns**:
- Live regions (`aria-live="polite"` for weather updates, `aria-live="assertive"` for errors)
- Combobox pattern for search with `aria-expanded`, `aria-autocomplete`, `aria-owns`
- List/listitem roles for structured data (weather details, forecast items)
- Descriptive labeling with `aria-label` and `aria-labelledby`

**Progressive Enhancement**: Base functionality works without JavaScript, enhanced with ARIA for assistive technologies.

## Current Context

**Current Task**: Implementing Task 12 - Accessibility Implementation (final accessibility layer)
**Phase**: Moving from comprehensive test creation to full implementation
**Immediate Goals**: 
- Complete all accessibility implementation files
- Ensure 100% test coverage passes
- Implement keyboard navigation handlers
- Add high contrast CSS support

**Files Being Modified**: `index.html`, `css/styles.css`, and all JS component files with accessibility enhancements.

## Progress Summary

**Completed**:
- ✅ Comprehensive accessibility test suite with 15+ test categories
- ✅ Complete semantic HTML structure with proper landmarks
- ✅ ARIA attributes for all interactive elements
- ✅ Screen reader optimized content structure
- ✅ Loading states and error handling with proper announcements

**Remaining**:
- CSS accessibility enhancements (high contrast, focus indicators)
- JavaScript keyboard navigation handlers
- Focus management utilities
- Search suggestion navigation
- Final integration testing

**Key Milestones**: This is Task 12 of 14 - nearing project completion with accessibility as critical final layer.

## Critical Issues & Learnings

**ARIA Complexity**: Complex widgets like search combobox require multiple ARIA attributes working together (`role="combobox"`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-autocomplete="list"`, `aria-owns`).

**Live Region Strategy**: Using both polite and assertive live regions - polite for weather updates, assertive for errors. Must manage content changes to trigger announcements properly.

**Focus Management**: Implementing proper focus trapping for modals and managing focus during dynamic content updates. Skip links essential for keyboard users.

**Screen Reader Considerations**: Temperature units must be explicitly announced, time-sensitive information needs clear labeling, and decorative elements must be hidden with `aria-hidden="true"`.

**Testing Approach**: Custom testing framework monitors DOM mutations for live region announcements and simulates keyboard interactions for comprehensive validation.

## Implementation Details

**Accessibility Testing Framework**: Built custom `AccessibilityTestRunner` class with:
- DOM mutation observers for live region monitoring
- Keyboard event simulation
- Focus management testing
- Accessible name calculation
- Visual state verification

**Search Accessibility**: Implemented combobox pattern with keyboard navigation support, suggestion list with proper roles, and escape key handling.

**Weather Data Presentation**: Used list/listitem roles for structured data, descriptive labels for all measurements including units, and proper heading hierarchy for content organization.

**Error Handling**: Implemented `role="alert"` for errors with `aria-live="assertive"` for immediate screen reader announcement.

**Technical Approach**: Layered accessibility implementation - semantic HTML base, ARIA enhancements, CSS accessibility features, and JavaScript interaction handlers. All focusable elements have proper tabindex management and visible focus indicators.

**Visual Accessibility**: Preparing high contrast mode support, ensuring color is not the only information conveyance method, and implementing scalable focus indicators.
