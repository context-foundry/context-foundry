# Pattern Library Integration - Complete ✅

## Overview

The pattern library has been **fully integrated** into Context Foundry's workflow. All four components from Prompt 4 are now actively used during builds.

## What Was Integrated

### 1. **Autonomous Orchestrator** (`workflows/autonomous_orchestrator.py`)

**Added:**
- Import statements for pattern library components (lines 19-22)
- `use_patterns` parameter to `__init__` (line 37)
- Pattern library and injector initialization (lines 66-75)
- Pattern injection in Scout phase (lines 151-160)
- Pattern injection in Architect phase (lines 208-218)
- Pattern injection in Builder phase (lines 299-309)
- Pattern extraction after successful build (lines 538-546)
- Session analysis with metrics (lines 548-565)
- Cleanup of pattern library (lines 567-569)

**Pattern Injection Flow:**
1. **Scout Phase**: Injects architectural patterns relevant to task
2. **Architect Phase**: Injects design/planning patterns
3. **Builder Phase**: Injects implementation patterns for each task

### 2. **Ralph Wiggum Runner** (`ace/ralph_wiggum.py`)

**Added:**
- Import statements (lines 21-24)
- Pattern library initialization (lines 71-77)
- Phase-specific pattern injection in iteration loop (lines 201-219)
- Pattern extraction on completion (lines 493-514)
- Session analysis on completion (lines 503-514)
- Cleanup (lines 516-518)

**Pattern Usage:**
- Patterns injected based on current phase (scout/architect/builder)
- Uses artifacts from previous phases as context
- Automatically extracts and analyzes on successful completion

### 3. **CLI Tool** (`tools/cli.py`)

**Updated:**
- `--use-patterns/--no-patterns` flag already existed (line 54)
- Connected flag to orchestrator (line 124)

**Usage:**
```bash
# With patterns (default)
foundry build my-app "Task description"

# Without patterns
foundry build my-app "Task description" --no-patterns
```

## How It Works

### During Build

1. **Pattern Injection (Before Each Phase)**
   - System searches pattern library for relevant patterns
   - Filters by success rate (≥70%) and relevance (≥0.6 similarity)
   - Top 3 patterns injected into Claude prompt
   - Patterns shown with success stats and usage count

2. **Code Generation**
   - Claude receives enhanced prompts with proven patterns
   - Can adapt or use patterns as starting points
   - Pattern usage tracked in database

### After Build

3. **Pattern Extraction**
   - Analyzes generated code using AST parsing
   - Identifies reusable classes, functions, and test patterns
   - Calculates complexity scores
   - Detects frameworks from imports
   - Stores unique patterns (checks similarity to avoid duplicates)

4. **Session Analysis**
   - Calculates completion rate, context efficiency
   - Measures time per task, token usage, estimated cost
   - Analyzes pattern effectiveness in this session
   - Auto-rates patterns based on completion rate:
     - 90%+ completion → 5-star rating
     - 70-89% → 4 stars
     - 50-69% → 3 stars
     - 30-49% → 2 stars
     - <30% → 1 star
   - Generates comprehensive Markdown report

## Pattern Library Stats

Check pattern library status:
```bash
foundry patterns --stats
```

Output shows:
- Total patterns stored
- Total usage count
- Average rating
- Patterns by language/framework

## Testing the Integration

### Test Pattern Injection
```bash
# Build with patterns (watch console output)
foundry build test-app "Create a REST API"

# You should see:
# 📚 Injected N relevant patterns
```

### Test Pattern Extraction
```bash
# After successful build
# You should see:
# 🔍 Extracting patterns from successful build...
# ✅ Extracted N new patterns
```

### Test Analysis
```bash
# Check the generated report
cat checkpoints/sessions/*_analysis.md
```

### Verify Database
```bash
# Check patterns stored
sqlite3 foundry/patterns/patterns.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM patterns;"

# Check usage
sqlite3 foundry/patterns/patterns.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pattern_usage;"
```

## Configuration

### Disable Patterns Globally
Edit `tools/cli.py` line 54:
```python
@click.option('--use-patterns/--no-patterns', default=False, ...)  # False = disabled
```

### Adjust Pattern Settings
Edit injector initialization in orchestrator (line 68):
```python
self.pattern_injector = PatternInjector(
    self.pattern_library,
    max_patterns=5,        # Inject up to 5 patterns
    min_success_rate=80.0, # Only patterns with 80%+ success
    min_relevance=0.7      # Higher relevance threshold
)
```

### Adjust Extraction Settings
Edit `foundry/patterns/pattern_extractor.py` default config:
```python
def _default_config(self) -> Dict:
    return {
        'min_complexity': 5,      # Higher complexity threshold
        'min_lines': 10,          # Longer code blocks only
        'max_similarity': 0.95,   # Allow more similar patterns
        ...
    }
```

4. ✅ `tools/analyze_session.py` - Post-build analysis

## Next Steps

1. **Build your first project with patterns:**
   ```bash
   foundry build demo "Create a simple API server"
   ```

2. **Check what patterns were learned:**
   ```bash
   foundry patterns --list
   ```

3. **Review the analysis report:**
   ```bash
   cat checkpoints/sessions/*_analysis.md
   ```

4. **Build another project and see patterns reused:**
   ```bash
   foundry build api2 "Another API with auth"
   # Watch for: 📚 Injected N relevant patterns
   ```

## Success Metrics

Track these over time:
- Pattern library growth (# of patterns)
- Pattern usage frequency
- Average pattern success rate
- Completion rate improvement
- Token efficiency gains
- Cost reduction per project

**Status: ✅ FULLY FUNCTIONAL**

The pattern library is now a core part of Context Foundry, continuously learning from successful builds and improving future ones.
