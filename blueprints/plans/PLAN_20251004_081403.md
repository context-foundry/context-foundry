# Implementation Plan: Todo CLI
Generated: 2025-10-04 08:14:05 UTC
Context Usage: 5% (New project with research)

## Approach
Build a modular Python CLI application using a layered architecture with clear separation between CLI interface, business logic, and data persistence. Prioritize simplicity, reliability, and testability over advanced features.

## Architecture Decisions
| Decision | Options Considered | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|-------------------|---------|-----------|
| Language | Python, Node.js, Go, Rust | Python | Best standard library for CLI/JSON, easy testing, cross-platform |
| CLI Library | argparse, click, typer | argparse | Standard library, zero dependencies, sufficient for simple commands |
| Storage Format | JSON, SQLite, CSV, YAML | JSON | Human-readable, standard library support, simple structure |
| ID Strategy | UUID, Sequential Int, Hash | Sequential Int | User-friendly, easy to type/remember, sufficient uniqueness |
| File Location | Current dir, Home dir, App data | ~/.todo/ | Standard practice, persists across sessions, user-specific |
| Architecture Pattern | Monolith, Layered, Hexagonal | Layered | Simple, clear separation, easy to test and extend |

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Foundation)
- Set up project structure with proper Python packaging
- Implement basic CLI argument parsing for three commands
- Create data models for Task with validation
- Build JSON storage layer with atomic write operations
- Add configuration management for file paths
- **Deliverable**: Basic CLI that can parse commands but doesn't execute them

### Phase 2: Business Logic (Core Features)
- Implement TodoManager with add, list, complete operations
- Add input validation and error handling
- Create task ID generation and lookup logic
- Implement file system initialization (create directories/files)
- Add comprehensive error messages and user feedback
- **Deliverable**: Fully functional CLI with all three commands

### Phase 3: Robustness (Production Ready)
- Add file locking for concurrent access protection
- Implement JSON schema validation and migration
- Add backup/recovery mechanisms for data safety
- Enhance error handling with specific error codes
- Optimize performance for large task lists
- **Deliverable**: Production-ready application with robust error handling

### Phase 4: User Experience (Polish)
- Improve output formatting and colorization
- Add comprehensive help documentation
- Implement input sanitization and edge case handling
- Add progress indicators for long operations
- Create installation and distribution scripts
- **Deliverable**: Polished CLI ready for end users

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- **Models**: Task creation, validation, serialization
- **Storage**: File operations, JSON parsing, error conditions
- **TodoManager**: Business logic, edge cases, validation
- **CLI**: Command parsing, output formatting, error handling

### Integration Testing
- **End-to-end workflows**: Add → List → Complete → List
- **File system interactions**: Directory creation, permissions, corruption recovery
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Windows/macOS/Linux path handling
- **Concurrent access**: Multiple instances, file locking

### Test Data Management
- **Fixtures**: Sample JSON files, various task states
- **Mocking**: File system operations, datetime for consistent timestamps
- **Temporary directories**: Isolated test environments
- **Edge cases**: Empty files, malformed JSON, permission errors

### Acceptance Testing
- **User scenarios**: Real-world usage patterns
- **Performance**: Response time under load, memory usage
- **Error recovery**: Corruption handling, graceful degradation
- **Documentation**: Help text accuracy, example validation

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|---------|------------|
| Data corruption from interrupted writes | Medium | High | Implement atomic writes via temp files + rename |
| Concurrent access causing data loss | Medium | High | File locking with timeout and retry logic |
| JSON parsing errors from manual edits | High | Medium | Schema validation with helpful error messages |
| Cross-platform path issues | Low | Medium | Use pathlib and platform-specific conventions |
| Performance degradation with many tasks | Low | Medium | Lazy loading and pagination for large lists |
| Package dependency conflicts | Low | Low | Use only standard library to avoid dependencies |
| User input validation bypass | Medium | Low | Comprehensive input sanitization and validation |
| Storage location permission issues | Medium | Medium | Fallback locations and clear error messages |
