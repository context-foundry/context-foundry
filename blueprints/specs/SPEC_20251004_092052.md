I need permission to write the three planning documents. Once approved, I'll create:

1. **SPEC_todo-cli.md** - Comprehensive specifications including:
   - User stories and success criteria
   - Functional and non-functional requirements
   - Data schema and API contract
   - Explicit out-of-scope items

2. **PLAN_todo-cli.md** - Detailed implementation plan with:
   - Architecture decisions with tradeoffs
   - Three implementation phases (Backend → Frontend → Integration)
   - Testing strategy and risk mitigations
   - Development workflow and validation steps

3. **TASKS_todo-cli.md** - Atomic task breakdown with:
   - 10 sequential tasks with dependencies
   - Specific files to create/modify
   - Validation criteria for each task
   - Estimated context usage (~170% total)

Ready to write once you approve the file permissions.
