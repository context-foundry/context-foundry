I need permission to write the planning documents. The files will be created in the blueprints directory:

1. `/Users/name/homelab/context-foundry/blueprints/specs/SPEC_20251004_091755.md`
2. `/Users/name/homelab/context-foundry/blueprints/plans/PLAN_20251004_091755.md`
3. `/Users/name/homelab/context-foundry/blueprints/tasks/TASKS_20251004_091755.md`

These will contain the comprehensive specifications, implementation plan, and detailed task breakdown for the todo web application.
