# Specification: Todo CLI
Generated: 2025-10-04 08:14:05 UTC
Context Usage: 5% (New project with research)

## Goal
Create a simple, reliable command-line todo application that allows users to add tasks, list all tasks, and mark tasks as complete using local JSON file storage.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to add a new task with a description so that I can track things I need to do
- As a user, I want to list all my tasks with their status so that I can see what needs to be done
- As a user, I want to mark tasks as complete so that I can track my progress
- As a user, I want my tasks to persist between sessions so that I don't lose my todo list
- As a user, I want clear feedback when commands succeed or fail so that I know the app is working correctly
- As a user, I want simple command syntax so that I can use the app efficiently

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Can add tasks with `todo add "Task description"`
- [ ] Can list all tasks with `todo list` showing ID, description, and status
- [ ] Can complete tasks with `todo complete <id>`
- [ ] Tasks persist in local JSON file between app runs
- [ ] Completed tasks are visually distinguished from pending tasks
- [ ] Invalid commands show helpful error messages
- [ ] App handles missing or corrupted JSON files gracefully
- [ ] Each task has a unique, user-friendly identifier
- [ ] App works cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- [ ] Zero external dependencies beyond Python standard library

## Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Command-line interface with three commands: add, list, complete
- Local JSON file storage in user's home directory
- Unique task IDs that are easy to reference (sequential integers)
- Task metadata: ID, description, completion status, timestamps
- Atomic file operations to prevent data corruption
- Input validation for task descriptions (non-empty, reasonable length)
- Error handling for file I/O operations

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Response time under 100ms for typical operations
- Support for up to 1000 tasks without performance degradation
- Clear, consistent error messages with actionable guidance
- Help documentation accessible via `todo --help`
- Graceful handling of concurrent access (file locking)
- Memory usage under 50MB for typical usage

### Platform Requirements
- Python 3.7+ compatibility
- Cross-platform file path handling
- Standard UNIX exit codes (0 for success, 1+ for errors)
- UTF-8 support for task descriptions
- Respects user permissions and file system constraints

### Data Requirements
- JSON schema validation for stored data
- Backup creation before destructive operations
- Migration strategy for future schema changes
- Human-readable JSON format for manual inspection/editing
- Default storage location: `~/.todo/tasks.json`

## Out of Scope
- Task editing/modification (can only add and complete)
- Task deletion or archiving
- Due dates or priorities
- Task categories or tags
- Multi-user support or synchronization
- Web interface or GUI
- Task search or filtering (beyond basic list)
- Undo/redo functionality
- Import/export to other formats
- Task dependencies or subtasks
- Recurring tasks or reminders
- Configuration files or customization options
