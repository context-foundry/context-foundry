## Goal
Fix the weather-web application that is stuck at "Loading weather data..." by switching from a paid API endpoint to a free endpoint.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to see weather data load successfully so that I can view current weather information
- As a user, I want clear error messages when weather data fails to load so that I understand what's happening
- As a developer, I want the application to use a free API endpoint so that it works without paid subscriptions
- As a developer, I want proper error handling so that the application doesn't hang indefinitely

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Weather data loads successfully without hanging at "Loading weather data..."
- [ ] Application uses a free weather API endpoint instead of paid endpoint
- [ ] Proper error handling displays meaningful messages when API calls fail
- [ ] Application handles rate limits gracefully with appropriate user feedback
- [ ] No authentication errors or billing-related failures occur
- [ ] Weather data displays correctly in the user interface
- [ ] Application works across different browsers without CORS issues

## Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Switch from paid weather API endpoint to free equivalent
- Maintain compatibility with existing weather data display format
- Implement proper error handling with user-friendly messages
- Add loading timeouts to prevent indefinite hanging
- Support basic weather data fields (temperature, conditions, location)

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Response time: Weather data should load within 10 seconds
- Reliability: Handle API failures gracefully without breaking UI
- Usability: Clear feedback for all loading states and errors
- Maintainability: Well-documented endpoint configuration
- Compatibility: Works in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### API Requirements
- Use free tier of weather service (OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI, etc.)
- Support for city-based weather queries
- JSON response format compatible with existing parsing logic
- No authentication required or use free API key
- Reasonable rate limits for typical usage

### Error Handling Requirements
- Network timeout handling (10-15 second timeout)
- Invalid API key error handling
- Rate limit exceeded error handling
- City not found error handling
- Network connectivity error handling
- Malformed response error handling

## Out of Scope
- Switching to a completely different weather service provider
- Adding premium weather features that require paid access
- Implementing user authentication or API key management
- Adding weather forecasting beyond basic current conditions
- Mobile app development or responsive design improvements
- Database storage of weather data or caching mechanisms
- Advanced weather visualization or charting features
