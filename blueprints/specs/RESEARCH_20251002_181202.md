# Research Report: 
    Create a simple FastAPI application with the following features:

    1. Health check endpoint (GET /)
    2. User model with id, name, email
    3. CRUD endpoints for users:
       - GET /users (list all)
       - GET /users/{id} (get one)
       - POST /users (create)
       - PUT /users/{id} (update)
       - DELETE /users/{id} (delete)
    4. In-memory storage (dictionary)
    5. Comprehensive tests for all endpoints
    6. README with setup instructions

    Follow Context Foundry workflow:
    - Scout: Research FastAPI patterns
    - Architect: Create spec and plan
    - Builder: Implement with tests
