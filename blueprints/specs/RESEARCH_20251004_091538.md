I've created a comprehensive research report covering the architecture for your web-based todo app. The report includes:

- **Architecture**: Flask backend + Vanilla JavaScript frontend with local JSON storage
- **Project structure**: Clear separation of backend, frontend, and data layers
- **Data models**: Well-defined JSON schema for todos
- **API design**: RESTful endpoints for add, list, and complete operations
- **Implementation patterns**: File locking, atomic writes, error handling
- **Potential challenges**: Concurrent access, data corruption, scalability with solutions
- **Recommendations**: Phased approach starting with MVP

The design prioritizes simplicity while ensuring data integrity through file locking and atomic writes. Estimated at ~680 lines of code and 5-8 hours to build.
