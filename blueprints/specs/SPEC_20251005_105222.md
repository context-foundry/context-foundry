Context Usage: 85%

## Goal
Fix the weather app so that entering a city name like "Houston" successfully retrieves and displays weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to enter a city name and see current weather information so that I can make informed decisions about my day
- As a user, I want to see clear error messages when something goes wrong so that I understand what happened
- As a user, I want the app to respond quickly so that I don't wait unnecessarily for weather data
- As a developer, I want comprehensive debug information so that I can troubleshoot issues effectively

## Success Criteria
- [ ] User can enter "Houston" and receive weather data within 3 seconds
- [ ] Weather data displays temperature, description, humidity, and wind speed
- [ ] Invalid city names show appropriate error messages
- [ ] Debug panel shows successful API requests with >0 requests made
- [ ] Network tab in browser shows actual HTTP requests to api.openweathermap.org
- [ ] Success rate remains high (>95%) for valid city requests
- [ ] App handles network failures gracefully with user-friendly messages

## Functional Requirements
- City input field accepts text input
- Submit mechanism (button or Enter key) triggers weather lookup
- API integration with OpenWeatherMap using current weather endpoint
- Display weather data in readable format
- Error handling for invalid cities, network issues, and API failures
- Debug panel updates with real-time metrics

## Technical Requirements
- Valid OpenWeatherMap API key properly configured
- HTTP requests use HTTPS and include proper headers
- API responses parsed and validated before display
- Event handlers properly bound to DOM elements
- CORS compliance for browser-based requests
- Rate limiting consideration for API usage
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- JavaScript ES6+ compatible code

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Response time: < 3 seconds for successful requests
- Availability: Handle API downtime gracefully
- Security: API key not exposed in client-side code
- Usability: Clear visual feedback during loading states
- Accessibility: Keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- Performance: Minimal bundle size and efficient DOM updates

## Out of Scope
- Multi-day weather forecasts
- Weather maps or visualizations
- User accounts or saved locations
- Geolocation-based weather detection
- Multiple weather data providers
- Mobile app versions
- Offline functionality
- Historical weather data
