# Specification: Todo Web Application

Context Usage: <5%

## Goal
Build a web-based todo application with add, list, and complete functionality using local JSON file storage.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to add new todo items so that I can track tasks I need to complete
- As a user, I want to view all my todo items so that I can see what needs to be done
- As a user, I want to mark todos as complete so that I can track my progress
- As a user, I want my todos to persist between sessions so that I don't lose my task list

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Users can add a new todo item with text description
- [ ] Users can view a list of all todo items (both active and completed)
- [ ] Users can mark a todo item as complete
- [ ] Todo items persist in a local JSON file (todos.json)
- [ ] The application runs on localhost with a web interface
- [ ] Completed todos are visually distinguished from active todos
- [ ] The application handles errors gracefully (empty input, invalid IDs, missing file)
- [ ] The application initializes with an empty todo list if no data file exists

## Technical Requirements

### Backend Requirements
- Node.js Express server serving REST API
- JSON file storage using native fs/promises module
- Three API endpoints:
  - GET /api/todos - Retrieve all todos
  - POST /api/todos - Create new todo
  - PATCH /api/todos/:id/complete - Mark todo as complete
- Static file serving for frontend assets
- CORS support for development
- Input validation (non-empty text, valid IDs)
- Proper HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 404, 500)
- Atomic file operations to prevent corruption

### Frontend Requirements
- Single-page application (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
- Form for adding new todos
- List view displaying all todos
- Complete button for each incomplete todo
- Visual indication of completed todos (strikethrough)
- Fetch API for server communication
- Load todos on page load
- Update UI after each operation

### Data Requirements
- Todo schema:
  - id: string (UUID or timestamp)
  - text: string (todo description)
  - completed: boolean
  - createdAt: ISO 8601 timestamp
  - completedAt: ISO 8601 timestamp or null
- Storage format: JSON object with todos array
- File location: data/todos.json
- Initialize with empty array if file doesn't exist

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Application must start with single command (npm start)
- Response time < 100ms for all operations
- Support for at least 1000 todos without performance degradation
- Clean, readable code with consistent style
- Error messages should be user-friendly

## Out of Scope
- User authentication/authorization
- Multiple users or user accounts
- Todo deletion functionality
- Editing existing todo text
- Todo categories or tags
- Due dates or reminders
- Sorting or filtering (show all/active/completed)
- Priority levels
- Bulk operations
- Data export/import
- Database integration
- Deployment to production server
- Mobile responsive design (basic usability acceptable)
- Real-time synchronization across multiple clients
- Undo/redo functionality
- Search functionality

## Constraints
- Must use local JSON file (no database)
- No external authentication services
- No third-party UI frameworks
- Single-user application (no concurrency guarantees)

## Assumptions
- Node.js v18+ is available on target system
- Application runs on localhost only
- Single user interacting with application at a time
- Modern browser with ES6+ support
- File system has write permissions in project directory
