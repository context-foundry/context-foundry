I need permission to create the specification files. These are the three critical planning documents that will guide the implementation:

1. **SPEC_todo-cli.md** - Comprehensive specification with user stories, success criteria, and technical requirements
2. **PLAN_todo-cli.md** - Technical implementation plan with architecture decisions and testing strategy  
3. **TASKS_todo-cli.md** - Detailed task breakdown with dependencies and execution order

May I proceed with creating these files in the `blueprints/specs/` directory?
