## Goal
Fix the weather-web application that is stuck at "Loading weather data..." by switching from a paid weather API endpoint to a free endpoint.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to see weather data displayed instead of an infinite loading state so that I can check current weather conditions
- As a developer, I want the application to use a free API endpoint so that it doesn't require paid API credentials
- As a user, I want clear error messages if the weather data cannot be loaded so that I understand what's happening
- As a developer, I want configurable API endpoints so that I can easily switch between free and paid tiers in the future

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Application successfully loads and displays weather data
- [ ] Loading state resolves within 5 seconds under normal conditions
- [ ] Application uses free weather API endpoint instead of paid endpoint
- [ ] No API authentication errors in browser console
- [ ] Weather data is properly formatted and displayed in the UI
- [ ] Error handling provides meaningful feedback to users
- [ ] Configuration is easily switchable between free/paid endpoints

## Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Switch API endpoint from paid to free tier
- Update API configuration to use appropriate free tier parameters
- Ensure API key (if required) is valid for free tier
- Maintain existing UI components and data display functionality
- Preserve current weather data fields where available in free tier

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Response time: Weather data should load within 5 seconds
- Reliability: Handle API rate limiting gracefully
- Maintainability: Clear separation between API configuration and business logic
- Error handling: Graceful degradation when API is unavailable
- Performance: Minimize unnecessary API calls

### Data Requirements
- Basic weather data: temperature, conditions, location
- Optional fields available in free tier: humidity, wind speed, forecast
- Proper handling of missing data fields not available in free tier
- Consistent data format for UI components

### Security Requirements
- API keys stored in environment variables, not hardcoded
- No exposure of sensitive configuration in client-side code
- Secure HTTPS API calls only

## Technical Constraints
- Must work with existing React component structure
- Cannot modify external weather API provider's response format
- Limited to free tier API rate limits and features
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing UI components

## Out of Scope
- Adding new weather data fields not available in free tier
- Implementing premium features that require paid API access
- Changing the overall application architecture or UI design
- Adding user authentication or personalization features
- Implementing offline/caching functionality (unless required for free tier limits)
- Migrating to a different weather API provider
