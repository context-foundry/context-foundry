## Architecture Planning Complete

I've created comprehensive planning documentation for the web-based todo application:

### **SPEC.md** (Specifications)
- 8 user stories covering core functionality and UX
- 16 success criteria across functional, technical, and non-functional requirements
- Detailed technical requirements for backend, frontend, and storage
- Clear scope definition with 20+ exclusions for phase 1
- Data constraints and validation rules

### **PLAN.md** (Implementation Plan)
- 9 architecture decisions with rationale (Framework: Flask, Frontend: Vanilla JS, Storage: JSON file)
- Complete system architecture with component diagrams and data flows
- 4 implementation phases: Backend Foundation → Frontend → Robustness → Deployment
- Comprehensive testing strategy with 23 test case checklist items
- Risk matrix with 10 identified risks and mitigations
- Performance targets and security considerations

### **TASKS.md** (Task Breakdown)
- 10 atomic tasks with clear dependencies
- Each task includes:
  - Files to create/modify
  - Specific code changes with examples
  - Test requirements
  - Estimated context usage
  - Completion criteria
- Total estimated context: 110%
- Critical path identified: Sequential execution with some parallelization opportunities

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- Python Flask backend for simplicity and rapid development
- Vanilla JavaScript frontend (no framework) to minimize complexity
- Thread-based locking with atomic file writes for data integrity
- UUID4 for ID generation
- REST API with proper HTTP status codes and error handling

**Ready for Builder Agent**: All three planning documents provide complete specifications for implementation without requiring file write access.
