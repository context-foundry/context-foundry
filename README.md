# 🏭 Context Foundry

> **The AI That Builds Itself: Recursive Claude Spawning via Meta-MCP**
> Context Foundry uses Claude Code to spawn fresh Claude instances that autonomously build complete projects. Walk away and come back to production-ready software.

**Version 2.1.0 - October 2025**

> **📌 Version Note:** This is Context Foundry **v2.x** (MCP server for Claude Code). For the legacy **v1.0** Python CLI with multi-provider support, see the [`v1.x-legacy` branch](https://github.com/context-foundry/context-foundry/tree/v1.x-legacy) or download [`v1.0-final` release](https://github.com/context-foundry/context-foundry/releases/tag/v1.0-final).

## What is Context Foundry?

Context Foundry is an **MCP (Model Context Protocol) server** that empowers Claude Code CLI to build complete software projects autonomously with **self-healing test loops** and **automatic GitHub deployment**.

Unlike traditional AI coding tools that require constant supervision, Context Foundry lets you describe what you want and **walk away** while it:
- Researches requirements (Scout phase)
- Designs architecture (Architect phase)
- Implements code with tests (Builder phase)
- Auto-fixes test failures (Test phase with self-healing)
- **Captures screenshots automatically** (Screenshot phase - NEW!)
- Documents everything with visual guides (Documentation phase)
- Deploys to GitHub (Deployment phase)

**Real Example:**
```
User: "Build a Mario platformer game in JavaScript"
[User walks away for 7 minutes]
Result: ✅ Complete game deployed to GitHub, all tests passing
```

---

## 🚀 The Breakthrough: Meta-MCP Innovation

**What makes Context Foundry unique?** Most MCP servers call external tools. Context Foundry does something radical: **it uses MCP to recursively spawn Claude Code itself**.

    style E fill:#d4edda
```

**The paradigm shift:**
- **Traditional MCP**: Claude → MCP → External System (database, API, etc.)
- **Context Foundry**: Claude → MCP → **Claude** (recursive spawning)

**Why this matters:**
- 🧠 **Fresh 200K context windows** - Each spawned Claude starts clean, no token accumulation
- 🔄 **Parallel execution** - Multiple Claude instances work simultaneously
- 🎯 **Autonomous decision-making** - Agents decide when to spawn new agents
- 🏗️ **Self-orchestration** - AI orchestrates AI through meta-prompts

## 🎮 See It In Action

**Example conversation** - Context Foundry builds a complete game autonomously:

```
You: Build a platformer game with player movement, enemies,
     collectibles, and multiple levels in JavaScript

Context Foundry: 🚀 Autonomous build started!

Project: platformer-game
Task ID: abc-123-def-456
Location: /tmp/platformer-game
Expected duration: 7-15 minutes

You can continue working - the build runs in the background.
```

**10 minutes later...**

```
You: What's the status?

Context Foundry: ✅ Build completed!

Phase 1: Scout ✓
  - Analyzed platformer game requirements
  - Recommended HTML5 Canvas + vanilla JS
  - Identified physics, collision, level design needs

Phase 2: Architect ✓
  - Designed game engine architecture
  - Planned Player, Enemy, Collectible classes
  - Created level data structure

Phase 3: Builder ✓
  - Implemented game loop and rendering
  - Added physics and collision detection
  - Created 3 levels with increasing difficulty

Phase 4: Test ✓ (2 iterations)
  - Iteration 1: Fixed collision edge cases
  - Iteration 2: All tests passing (15/15)

Phase 5: Deploy ✓
  - Deployed to GitHub: github.com/you/platformer-game
  - README with screenshots generated
  - GitHub Pages enabled

Total time: 12 minutes
Files created: 12 (game.js, player.js, level.js, tests/, docs/)
```

**Key Takeaway:** User described what they wanted, walked away, came back to a finished, tested, documented, and deployed application.

## 📚 Understanding Context Foundry

### How It Really Works (No Magic, Just Transparency)

**Key Insight:** Context Foundry does NOT modify Claude Code. It uses **delegation** to spawn separate Claude instances that do the work.

```
Your Claude Window (stays clean)
    ↓
    "Build a weather app"
    ↓
MCP Server spawns → Fresh Claude Instance
                    (runs all 7 phases)
                    (builds entire project)
                    ↓
                    Returns summary
    ↓
Your Claude Window shows: "Build complete! ✅"
```

**Why your context usage stays low:** The heavy work happens in a separate Claude instance!

### Where Are My Build Artifacts?

**Every project gets a `.context-foundry/` directory:**

```
your-project/
└── .context-foundry/
    ├── architecture.md      ← Architect's complete plan (30-90KB!)
    ├── scout-report.md      ← Research findings
    ├── build-log.md         ← Implementation log
    ├── test-final-report.md ← Test results
    └── session-summary.json ← Build metadata
```

**Example - View VimQuest's architecture plan:**
```bash
cat /Users/name/homelab/vimquest/.context-foundry/architecture.md
```

### Pattern Library Location

**Global patterns** (shared across ALL builds):
```
/Users/name/homelab/context-foundry/.context-foundry/patterns/
├── common-issues.json
├── test-patterns.json
├── architecture-patterns.json
└── scout-learnings.json
```

**How it works:**
- Each build reads global patterns
- Applies past learnings automatically
- Discovers new patterns
- Updates library for future builds

**See what Context Foundry has learned:**
```bash
cat /Users/name/homelab/context-foundry/.context-foundry/patterns/common-issues.json
```

### Common Questions

❓ **Did Context Foundry change Claude Code's system prompt?**
✅ **No!** It spawns separate Claude instances via delegation. Your regular Claude Code usage is unaffected.

❓ **Where can I find the architect's plan?**
✅ `<your-project>/.context-foundry/architecture.md`

❓ **Why is my context usage so low?**
✅ The build runs in a **separate Claude instance**. Your main window just monitors progress.

❓ **What happens to the agents after the build?**
✅ They're ephemeral - disappear after the build. Only artifacts and patterns persist.

❓ **Can I review the plan before building?**
✅ Yes! Use `autonomous=False` to enable checkpoints, or review `architecture.md` after completion.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10 or higher** (for MCP server)
- **Claude Code CLI** installed and in PATH
- **Claude subscription or API** - Uses your existing Claude Code authentication
- **Git** and **GitHub CLI** (for deployment features)

### Installation

#### Stable Release (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Clone Context Foundry
git clone https://github.com/context-foundry/context-foundry.git

# IMPORTANT: Change into the context-foundry directory
cd context-foundry

# 2. Create virtual environment (recommended, required on Debian-based systems)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install MCP server dependencies (Python 3.10+ required)
# This is a minimal installation - only ~50MB, installs in 15-20 seconds
pip install -r requirements-mcp.txt

# 3a. [Optional] Install BAML for type-safe LLM outputs
pip install -r requirements-baml.txt

# 4. Configure Claude Code to connect to MCP server
# Use absolute paths with $(pwd) and add to project scope (-s project)
claude mcp add --transport stdio context-foundry -s project -- $(pwd)/venv/bin/python $(pwd)/tools/mcp_server.py

# This uses $(pwd) to automatically get absolute paths
# The -s project flag creates .mcp.json in the project directory (shareable with team)

# 5. Verify the config was created
cat .mcp.json
# Should show the server configuration with your paths

# Note: Project-scoped servers don't appear in `claude mcp list` (that shows global config)
# They're automatically detected when you run `claude` in this directory

# 6. Authenticate with GitHub (for deployment)
gh auth login
```

**Detailed setup guide:** See [CLAUDE_CODE_MCP_SETUP.md](CLAUDE_CODE_MCP_SETUP.md) for troubleshooting and advanced configuration.

#### Nightly Builds (Bleeding Edge)

For the latest features and fixes before they're in a stable release:

```bash
# 1. Clone and checkout the latest nightly
git clone https://github.com/context-foundry/context-foundry.git
cd context-foundry

# 2. List available nightly releases
git tag --list 'v*-nightly.*' --sort=-v:refname | head -5

# 3. Checkout specific nightly (example)
git checkout v2.1.0-nightly.20251025

# 4. Continue with standard setup (venv, pip install, etc.)
```

**About Nightly Releases:**
- 🌙 **Built daily** at midnight UTC if there are new commits
- 🏷️ **Format:** `v{VERSION}-nightly.{YYYYMMDD}` (e.g., `v2.1.0-nightly.20251025`)
- ⚡ **Latest features** that haven't been released in stable yet
- 🔬 **Pre-release quality** - May contain bugs, use stable releases for production
- 📋 **Auto-generated release notes** - Grouped by commit type (feat, fix, docs, etc.)
- 🔄 **Retained for 30 days** then automatically cleaned up

**View nightly releases:** [GitHub Releases (Pre-releases)](https://github.com/context-foundry/context-foundry/releases?q=prerelease%3Atrue)

### Basic Usage

Start Claude Code CLI:

```bash
claude
```

Inside your Claude Code session:

#### Build a New Project (Autonomous)

```
Use mcp__autonomous_build_and_deploy with:
- task: "Build a weather API with Express.js that fetches data from OpenWeatherMap"
- working_directory: "/tmp/weather-api"
- github_repo_name: "weather-api"
- enable_test_loop: true
```

**What happens:**
1. Build starts immediately in the background
2. You get a task_id to check progress
3. **You can continue working** while it builds!
4. System completes autonomously:
   - Scout researches requirements (1-2 min)
   - Architect designs system (1-2 min)
   - Builder implements code + tests (2-5 min)
   - Tester validates (tests fail? auto-fixes up to 3x)
   - **Screenshot Capturer takes visual documentation (30-60 sec)**
   - Documentation created with screenshots (1 min)
   - Deployed to GitHub (30 sec)

**Total:** ~7-15 minutes, zero human input required.

**Check status anytime:**
```
What's the status of my build?
```

Claude will automatically check and report progress.

#### Delegate a Simple Task

```
Use mcp__delegate_to_claude_code with:
- task: "Create a Python script that fetches weather data and prints it nicely"
- working_directory: "/tmp/weather-script"
```

Returns when complete with full output.

#### Parallel Task Execution

```
Use mcp__delegate_to_claude_code_async to start these tasks in parallel:

Task 1: "Create Flask REST API for user authentication"
  working_directory: "/tmp/project/backend"

Task 2: "Create React frontend with login UI"
  working_directory: "/tmp/project/frontend"

Task 3: "Create PostgreSQL schema and migrations"
  working_directory: "/tmp/project/database"

Then use mcp__list_delegations to monitor progress
And mcp__get_delegation_result to collect results when ready
```

**Time saved:** 3 sequential tasks (30 min) → parallel tasks (10 min) = 3x faster

---

## Background Builds (Non-Blocking Execution)

**The best part:** Builds run in the background by default! You can continue working in your Claude Code session while projects build autonomously.

### How It Works

When you trigger a build (by saying "Build a weather app" or using the MCP tool directly), the system:

1. **Starts immediately** - Spawns a background Claude Code process
2. **Returns task_id** - Gives you a tracking ID
3. **Runs autonomously** - Completes all phases without blocking you
4. **Notifies when done** - You can check status anytime

### Example Workflow

```
You: Build a todo app with React and localStorage

Claude: 🚀 Autonomous build started!

Project: todo-app
Task ID: abc-123-def-456
Location: /tmp/todo-app
Expected duration: 7-15 minutes

You can continue working - the build runs in the background.

You: [Continue working on other things]

[10 minutes later]

You: What's the status of task abc-123-def-456?

Claude: ✅ Build completed!

GitHub: https://github.com/snedea/todo-app
Tests: 25/25 passing
Duration: 8.3 minutes
```

### Checking Build Status

**Ask naturally:**
```
What's the status of my build?
How's the todo app build going?
Is task abc-123-def-456 done?
```

**Or use the MCP tool directly:**
```
Use mcp__get_delegation_result with task_id "abc-123-def-456"
```

### Listing All Active Builds

```
What builds are running?
Show me all active tasks
```

Or:

```
Use mcp__list_delegations
```

### Benefits of Background Builds

- ✅ **No blocking** - Keep working while builds run
- ✅ **Parallel work** - Build multiple projects simultaneously
- ✅ **Better UX** - Natural workflow, no waiting
- ✅ **Check anytime** - Monitor progress when convenient

**Note:** If you want synchronous execution (wait for completion), you can explicitly request the non-async version, but async is recommended for the best experience.

## ⚡ Smart Incremental Builds (NEW in v2.1.0)

**Speed up repeated builds by 10-40%** with intelligent caching and phase skipping!

### What Are Incremental Builds?

Smart Incremental Builds cache expensive operations (like Scout research) and skip them on subsequent builds of the same or similar projects. This means:

- **Faster iterations** - Skip phases that don't need to rerun
- **Efficient development** - Cache Scout reports for similar tasks
- **Automatic optimization** - System decides what to cache and when to reuse

### Performance Impact

**Real-world results** from production testing:

| Scenario | Build Time (Normal) | Build Time (Incremental) | Speedup |
|----------|---------------------|--------------------------|---------|
| **Best Case** | 29 minutes | 18 minutes | **37.4% faster** ✅ |
| **Average** | 29 minutes | 25 minutes | 12-15% faster |
| **Cache Creation** | 29 minutes | 33 minutes | Slightly slower (creating cache) |

**Key Insight**: First build with `incremental=True` creates the cache (slightly slower). Subsequent similar builds are significantly faster!

### How to Use

#### Enable Incremental Mode

Simply add `incremental=True` when building:

```
Build a weather app with incremental mode enabled
```

Or explicitly:

```
Use mcp__autonomous_build_and_deploy:
- task: "Build a weather app"
- working_directory: "/tmp/weather-app"
- incremental: true
```

#### What Gets Cached

**Scout Cache** (✅ Working):
- Task analysis and research findings
- Technology stack recommendations
- Architecture insights
- **Reused when**: Similar task within 24 hours
- **Speedup**: ~2-5 minutes saved per build

**Test Cache** (🔧 In Development):
- Test results when code hasn't changed
- File change detection via SHA256 hashing
- **Speedup**: ~3-5 minutes saved (when implemented)

### Cache Behavior

**Cache is per-project** (Phase 1):
```
your-project/
└── .context-foundry/
    └── cache/
        ├── scout-{hash}.md         # Cached Scout reports
        ├── scout-{hash}.meta.json  # Cache metadata
        └── (more cache files...)
```

**Cache TTL**: 24 hours (automatic expiration)

**Cache Key**: Generated from task description + mode
- "Build a todo app" → Same cache key as "Build a todo application"
- Task normalization catches minor wording differences

### When to Use Incremental Mode

**✅ Use incremental mode when:**
- Iterating on the same project
- Building similar apps repeatedly
- Making small changes to existing code
- Running documentation-only updates

**❌ Don't use incremental mode when:**
- Building completely different projects
- You want a clean build from scratch
- Testing the build system itself

### Force Full Rebuild

Bypass cache even with incremental mode:

```
Use mcp__autonomous_build_and_deploy:
- task: "Build weather app"
- working_directory: "/tmp/weather-app"
- incremental: true
- force_rebuild: true  # Bypass all caches
```

### Cache Management

**Check cache status:**
```python
from tools.cache.cache_manager import CacheManager

manager = CacheManager("/tmp/your-project")
manager.print_stats()
```

**Clear cache:**
```python
manager.clear_all()  # Clear all caches
manager.clear_by_type("scout")  # Clear only Scout cache
```

### Roadmap: Phase 2 (Coming Soon)

Phase 1 (current) provides 10-40% speedup. **Phase 2 will deliver 70-90% speedup** on rebuilds:

**Planned Features**:
- **Global Scout Cache** - Share cache across all projects
- **File-Level Change Detection** - Only rebuild changed modules
- **Incremental Builder** - Preserve unchanged files
- **Test Impact Analysis** - Only run affected tests
- **Incremental Documentation** - Update only changed docs

**Expected Impact**:
- Small code changes: 70-90% faster
- Documentation-only updates: 95% faster
- Similar projects: 50-70% faster

## MCP Tools Reference

### 🚀 `autonomous_build_and_deploy_async()` (Recommended)

Fully autonomous Scout → Architect → Builder → Test → Deploy workflow that runs in the **background** (non-blocking).

**Why async is better:**
- ✅ Continue working while build runs
- ✅ Build multiple projects simultaneously
- ✅ No session blocking (7-15 min builds don't freeze Claude)
- ✅ Check status anytime

**Parameters:**
- `task` (required): What to build (e.g., "Build a todo app")
- `working_directory` (required): Where to build it
- `github_repo_name` (optional): Deploy to this GitHub repo
- `existing_repo` (optional): Enhance existing repo instead
- `mode` (default: "new_project"): "new_project" | "fix" | "enhance"
- `enable_test_loop` (default: true): Enable self-healing when tests fail
- `max_test_iterations` (default: 3): Max auto-fix attempts
- `timeout_minutes` (default: 90.0): Total timeout

**Returns:** JSON with task_id and status message (build continues in background)

**Note:** When you naturally say "Build a weather app", Claude Code automatically uses this async version.

### 🚀 `autonomous_build_and_deploy()` (Synchronous)

Same as async version above, but **blocks** your Claude Code session until complete.

**When to use:**
- You specifically want to wait for the build
- You're debugging and need immediate output
- You prefer synchronous workflows

**Returns:** JSON with complete results after build finishes (7-15 min wait)

**Example:**
```python
{
  "status": "completed",
  "phases_completed": ["scout", "architect", "builder", "test", "docs", "deploy"],
  "github_url": "https://github.com/snedea/weather-api",
  "files_created": ["server.js", "tests/api.test.js", "README.md", ...],
  "tests_passed": true,
  "test_iterations": 2,
  "duration_minutes": 7.42
}
```

### ⚡ `delegate_to_claude_code()`

Synchronous delegation - starts task and waits for completion.

**Parameters:**
- `task` (required): Task description
- `working_directory` (optional): Where to run (default: current)
- `timeout_minutes` (default: 10.0): Max execution time
- `additional_flags` (optional): CLI flags to pass

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Build Express.js Weather API

```
Use mcp__autonomous_build_and_deploy:
- task: "Build Express.js weather API that fetches from OpenWeatherMap, includes caching with Redis, rate limiting, error handling, and comprehensive tests"
- working_directory: "/tmp/weather-api"
- github_repo_name: "weather-api"
- enable_test_loop: true
```

**Result:**
- Duration: 8.3 minutes
- Files: 12 (server.js, routes/, controllers/, tests/, README.md, etc.)
- Tests: 15/15 passed (iteration 1 failed, auto-fixed)
- Deployed: https://github.com/snedea/weather-api

### Example 2: Build Mario Platformer Game

```
Use mcp__autonomous_build_and_deploy:
- task: "Build a Mario-style platformer game in vanilla JavaScript with HTML5 Canvas. Include player movement (left, right, jump), collision detection, multiple levels, enemies, and score tracking"
- working_directory: "/tmp/mario-game"
- github_repo_name: "mario-game"
- enable_test_loop: true
```

**Result:**
- Duration: 7.42 minutes
- Files: 8 (index.html, game.js, player.js, level.js, physics.js, tests/, docs/)
- Tests: 12/12 passed (iteration 2 after collision fix)
- Deployed: https://github.com/snedea/mario-game

### Example 3: Parallel Full-Stack Build

```
# Start backend
Use mcp__delegate_to_claude_code_async:
- task: "Create Python Flask REST API with JWT authentication, PostgreSQL database, user registration/login endpoints, and tests"
- working_directory: "/tmp/fullstack/backend"

# Start frontend (in parallel)
Use mcp__delegate_to_claude_code_async:
- task: "Create React SPA with login form, registration form, protected routes, JWT token management, and tests"
- working_directory: "/tmp/fullstack/frontend"

# Start database (in parallel)
Use mcp__delegate_to_claude_code_async:
- task: "Create PostgreSQL schema with users table, migrations, seed data, and setup scripts"
- working_directory: "/tmp/fullstack/database"

# Monitor progress
Use mcp__list_delegations

# Collect results
Use mcp__get_delegation_result for each task_id
```

**Result:**
- Sequential time: ~30 minutes (10 min each)
- Parallel time: ~12 minutes (limited by slowest task)
- Time saved: 18 minutes (60% faster)

## Self-Healing Test Loop in Action

**Scenario:** Building Express.js authentication API

```
PHASE 4 - TEST (Iteration 1):

Running: npm test

❌ FAIL: POST /auth/login should return JWT token
   Expected: 200
   Received: 500
   Error: UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: JWT secret not defined

[SYSTEM ANALYZES FAILURE]

Tester Agent:
- Root cause: generateToken() throws when JWT_SECRET undefined
- Missing: Error handling in auth controller
- Fix needed: Add try-catch, validate environment on startup

[SYSTEM REDESIGNS]

Architect Agent:
- Updates architecture.md with error handling requirements
- Creates fixes-iteration-1.md with specific code changes

[SYSTEM RE-IMPLEMENTS]

Builder Agent:
- Adds try-catch to auth controller
- Adds JWT_SECRET validation at startup
- Updates .env.example with required variables

[SYSTEM RE-TESTS]

PHASE 4 - TEST (Iteration 2):

Running: npm test

✅ PASS: All tests (3/3)
   ✓ POST /auth/login should return JWT token
   ✓ POST /auth/login should reject invalid credentials
   ✓ GET /auth/verify should validate token

[SYSTEM CONTINUES TO DEPLOYMENT]
```

**Total auto-fix time:** ~2 minutes

**Human intervention:** Zero

## Configuration

### Custom Python Version

If you need a specific Python version for the MCP server:

Edit `~/.config/claude-code/mcp_settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context-foundry": {
      "command": "/usr/local/bin/python3.11",
      "args": ["/path/to/context-foundry/tools/mcp_server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables

Pass environment variables to MCP server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context-foundry": {
      "command": "python3.10",
      "args": ["/path/to/context-foundry/tools/mcp_server.py"],
      "env": {
        "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "your-key",
        "OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY": "your-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Disable MCP Server

Temporarily disable without deleting configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context-foundry": {
      "disabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Server Won't Start

**Error:** `ImportError: No module named 'fastmcp'`

**Solution:**
```bash
# Make sure you're in the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Then install dependencies (minimal installation, ~50MB)
pip install -r requirements-mcp.txt
# Or specifically:
pip install fastmcp>=2.0.0 nest-asyncio>=1.5.0
# Note: Previous versions required ~3-4GB of ML libraries - no longer needed!
```

**Error:** `externally-managed-environment` (Debian/Ubuntu systems)

**Solution:**
```bash
# Create a virtual environment first (best practice)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Then install dependencies
pip install -r requirements-mcp.txt
```

**Error:** Python version too old

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check version (must be 3.10+)
python3 --version

# Use specific version if available
python3.10 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-mcp.txt
```

### Claude Code Doesn't See MCP Tools

**Symptoms:** `mcp__autonomous_build_and_deploy` not available

**Solutions:**

1. Verify MCP settings exist:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.config/claude-code/mcp_settings.json
   ```

2. Check path is correct:
   ```bash
   ls /path/to/context-foundry/tools/mcp_server.py
   ```

3. Restart Claude Code:
   ```bash
   # Exit current session and restart
   claude
   ```

4. Verify connection:
   ```bash
   claude mcp list
   # Should show: ✓ Connected: context-foundry
   ```

### Delegations Timeout

**Symptoms:** Tasks consistently hit timeout

**Solutions:**

1. Increase timeout:
   ```
   Use mcp__autonomous_build_and_deploy:
   - timeout_minutes: 120.0
   ```

2. Break into smaller tasks:
   - Instead of "Build entire application"
   - Use: Multiple delegations for modules

3. Check if task requires manual input (shouldn't happen with `--permission-mode bypassPermissions`)

### Tests Keep Failing

**Symptoms:** Test loop reaches max iterations without passing

**Solutions:**

1. Check test failure reports:
   ```bash
   cat .context-foundry/test-results-iteration-*.md
   ```

2. Review fix attempts:
   ```bash
   cat .context-foundry/fixes-iteration-*.md
   ```

3. Increase max iterations if issue seems fixable:
   ```
   Use mcp__autonomous_build_and_deploy:
   - max_test_iterations: 5
   ```

4. Disable test loop to see raw test output:
   ```
   Use mcp__autonomous_build_and_deploy:
   - enable_test_loop: false
   ```

### MCP Server Failed (Status: ✘ failed)

**Most common cause:** Dependencies not installed because venv wasn't activated.

**Symptoms:**
- `/mcp` shows "Status: ✘ failed"
- MCP tools not available in Claude Code

**Quick fix:**
```bash
cd ~/homelab/context-foundry

# 1. Activate venv (CRITICAL!)
source venv/bin/activate

# 2. Verify you see (venv) prefix in prompt
# Should look like: (venv) you@computer:~/homelab/context-foundry$

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements-mcp.txt

# 4. Verify
python -c "from fastmcp import FastMCP; print('✅ Success!')"

# 5. Restart Claude Code
```

**Prevention:** Always activate venv BEFORE running pip install. Look for `(venv)` prefix in your prompt.

### Build Succeeded But Exit Code -15

**Symptoms:**
- Build process shows exit code -15 or SIGTERM
- Build files exist and work perfectly
- Process reports "failure"

**What really happened:**
- ✅ Your build **DID** succeed! All files were created and tested.
- ❌ GitHub deployment failed (missing `gh` CLI or not authenticated)
- ⚠️ Older versions incorrectly reported this as a build failure

**Verify build succeeded:**
```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
ls -la  # Files should exist
npm run dev  # Try running it
```

**To deploy manually:**
```bash
# Install gh CLI if needed
# macOS: brew install gh
# Linux: sudo apt install gh

gh auth login
gh repo create project-name --public --source=. --push
```

**Prevention:** Run `gh auth login` before building, or say: "Build locally only, skip GitHub deployment"

### Missing README or .gitignore

**Symptoms:**
- No README.md in project root
- No .gitignore file

**Cause:** Using older version of Context Foundry (before Build Finalization feature).

**Solution:**
```bash
# Update to latest version
cd ~/homelab/context-foundry
git pull origin main
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-mcp.txt --upgrade
```

**More help:** See [docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for comprehensive troubleshooting and [docs/LINUX_SETUP.md](docs/LINUX_SETUP.md) for Linux-specific setup.

## 💰 Cost Model & BAML Integration

### **CRITICAL: What Runs on Your Subscription vs API Keys**

Context Foundry has **two layers** - understanding this is essential:

#### **Layer 1: Core Build System (FREE - Uses Your Claude Code Subscription)**

**ALL the main work runs on your Claude Code subscription:**
- ✅ **Scout Agent** - Codebase research, requirement analysis
- ✅ **Architect Agent** - System design, architecture planning
- ✅ **Builder Agents** (2-8 parallel) - ALL code implementation
- ✅ **Test Agent** - Running tests, analyzing failures
- ✅ **Self-Healing Loop** - Auto-fixing test failures (redesign → rebuild → retest)
- ✅ **Screenshot Agent** - Visual documentation capture
- ✅ **Documentation Agent** - README and guide generation
- ✅ **Deploy Agent** - GitHub deployment

**These agents account for 99%+ of the token usage** and run entirely under your **Claude subscription** (unlimited usage).

#### **Layer 2: BAML Type-Safety (OPTIONAL - Requires API Key)**

**BAML is an optional add-on for type-safe validation:**
- ⚙️ Phase tracking validation (~10-15 calls/build)
- ⚙️ Scout report structure validation (1 call/build)
- ⚙️ Architecture blueprint validation (1 call/build)
- ⚙️ Build result validation (5-10 calls/build)

**BAML token usage: ~17,000 tokens per build**

**BAML cost: ~$0.20 per build** (20 cents)

**What you get:**
- Guaranteed valid JSON structures
- Compile-time schema validation
- Type-safe outputs
- Multi-provider support (Claude/GPT/Gemini)

**What you lose if disabled:**
- Simple JSON validation instead (works fine!)
- No type checking (but JSON parsing still works)

### Cost Comparison Table

| Component | Runs On | Cost | Token Usage | What It Does |
|-----------|---------|------|-------------|--------------|
| **Scout Agent** | Claude Code subscription | $0 (included) | ~15,000 tokens | Research & requirements |
| **Architect Agent** | Claude Code subscription | $0 (included) | ~25,000 tokens | System design |
| **Builder Agents (2-8×)** | Claude Code subscription | $0 (included) | ~100,000 tokens | **All code implementation** |
| **Test Agent** | Claude Code subscription | $0 (included) | ~20,000 tokens | Test execution & analysis |
| **Self-Healing (1-3×)** | Claude Code subscription | $0 (included) | ~30,000 tokens/iteration | Auto-fix test failures |
| **Screenshot Agent** | Claude Code subscription | $0 (included) | ~5,000 tokens | Visual docs |
| **Docs Agent** | Claude Code subscription | $0 (included) | ~10,000 tokens | README generation |
| **Deploy Agent** | Claude Code subscription | $0 (included) | ~5,000 tokens | GitHub deployment |
| **BAML Validation** | API key (optional) | **~$0.20/build** | ~17,000 tokens | Type-safe validation |

**Total per build:**
- **With BAML:** $0.20 (subscription covers 99%, BAML adds $0.20)
- **Without BAML:** $0 (100% covered by subscription)

### BAML: Keep or Disable?

**Disable BAML (Recommended for most users):**
```bash
# Simply don't set API keys in .env
# BAML automatically falls back to JSON mode
# Zero additional cost
```

**Enable BAML (If you want type safety):**
```bash
# Set API key in .env
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."

# Cost: ~$0.20 per build
# ~$2/month for 10 builds
# ~$10/month for 50 builds
```

**Our recommendation:** Try Context Foundry without BAML first. If you need stronger type guarantees, enable it later.

## Performance & Cost

### Performance Metrics

Based on real-world usage:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Avg build time** | 7-15 minutes (simple to moderate projects) |
| **Test auto-fix success** | 95% (within 3 iterations) |
| **Parallel speedup** | 3-10x (vs sequential) |
| **Token efficiency** | No limits (file-based context) |
| **Code quality** | 90%+ test coverage |

### Cost Comparison

**Context Foundry 1.x (API mode):**
```
Per project: $3-10 (pay-per-token)
100 projects: $300-1000
```

**Context Foundry (Claude subscription):**
```
Subscription: Unlimited usage included
100 projects: Covered by subscription

Break-even: ~5 projects per month vs API mode
```

**Savings:** 95%+ for heavy users

## Philosophy

**Context Foundry Philosophy:**
- **Autonomous over supervised**: Walk away while it builds
- **Self-healing over manual debugging**: Auto-fix test failures
- **File-based over conversation-based**: No token limits
- **Quality over speed**: Tests must pass before deployment
- **Simplicity over features**: Do one thing excellently

**Design Principles:**
- ✅ AI orchestrates itself (meta-prompts, not Python)
- ✅ Native tools over custom wrappers (Claude Code Read/Edit/Bash)
- ✅ File artifacts over conversation memory (.context-foundry/ directory)
- ✅ Self-healing over checkpoints (auto-fix instead of human review)
- ✅ GitHub deployment over local-only (share your work)
