## What is Context Foundry?

Context Foundry transforms fuzzy requests into clean, reviewable PRs through disciplined three-phase execution. It's the opposite of "vibe coding" - instead of chaotic back-and-forth with AI, it's systematic progression through research, planning, and implementation.

**Core Innovation**: Automated Context Engineering (ACE) - maintaining <40% context utilization while building complex software. Inspired by [Dexter Horthy's approach at HumanLayer](https://youtu.be/IS_y40zY-hc?si=ZMg7I3FKILvI8Fff) and Anthropic's [agent SDK patterns](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-agents-with-the-claude-agent-sdk).

## Philosophy: Workflow Over Prompt Perfection

**You don't need to master prompt engineering.** Context Foundry's power comes from structured refinement, not from crafting the perfect initial prompt:

- **Initial prompt**: Just describe what you want (1-2 sentences, "good enough")
- **Scout phase**: AI researches and proposes architecture
- **Architect phase**: You review and edit the SPEC/PLAN/TASKS files directly
- **Builder phase**: AI builds exactly what you approved

**The difference:**
```
Traditional approach:          Context Foundry approach:
├─ Perfect prompt (30 min)    ├─ Quick prompt (2 min)
├─ Hope for the best          ├─ Review plan (5 min)
├─ Get 70% of what you want   ├─ Edit to 100% accuracy
└─ Iterate via chat           └─ Approve and build
```

Your initial prompt gets you ~80% there. Editing the plan at the critical checkpoint gets you to 100%. **This is workflow over vibes.**

## The Three-Phase Workflow

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Fuzzy Request] --> B[🔍 SCOUT]
    B --> C[Research Artifact]
    C --> D[📐 ARCHITECT]
    D --> E[Spec + Plan + Tasks]
    E --> F[🔨 BUILDER]
    F --> G[Clean PRs]

    H[Human Review] --> C
    H --> E
    H --> G
```

### Phase 1: Scout (Research)

- Systematically explores the codebase
- Follows execution paths, not random files
- Produces compact research artifact (max 5K tokens)
- Context target: <30%
- Uses [subagent isolation patterns](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-agents-with-the-claude-agent-sdk) for efficient exploration

### Phase 2: Architect (Planning)

- Creates specifications from research
- Generates technical plans with alternatives considered
- Decomposes into atomic, testable tasks
- Context target: <40%
- **CRITICAL**: Human review required (highest leverage point)
- **Customizable**: Edit the generated SPEC/PLAN/TASKS files before approving - your changes will be used by the Builder

### Phase 3: Builder (Implementation)

- Executes tasks sequentially
- Test-driven development (tests first)
- Continuous context compaction
- Git checkpoint after each task
- Context target: <50%

## Quick Start

**New to Context Foundry?** Check out the [30-Minute Tutorial](docs/TUTORIAL.md) for a complete walkthrough from installation to your first PR.

### Installation

```bash
# Install Context Foundry
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/context-foundry.git
cd context-foundry

# Base installation (works with Python 3.9+)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Optional: MCP mode (requires Python 3.10+)
pip install -r requirements-mcp.txt

# On macOS, add foundry to PATH
export PATH="$HOME/Library/Python/3.9/bin:$PATH"  # Adjust Python version as needed
source ~/.zshrc

# Choose your mode:

# Option A: API Mode (standalone CLI - recommended for now)
# Set your Anthropic API key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Verify setup
foundry --version
```

**Two Ways to Use Context Foundry:**

| Mode | Cost | Setup | Status |
|------|------|-------|--------|
| **API Mode** | ~$3-10 per project (pay per token) | Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | ✅ **Works now - Recommended** |
| **MCP Mode** | Requires Claude Pro/Max ($20/month) | [Setup Guide](docs/MCP_SETUP.md) | ⚠️ **Not yet functional** - awaiting Claude Desktop sampling support |

💡 **Current Recommendation**: Use API mode. MCP mode is fully implemented but Claude Desktop doesn't yet support the required "sampling" feature. When available, MCP mode will use your Claude subscription instead of incurring additional per-token API charges.

### Basic Usage

Context Foundry works in two modes:

#### Option 1: MCP Mode (via Claude Desktop) - ⚠️ Not Yet Functional

> **Note:** MCP mode is fully implemented but doesn't work yet because Claude Desktop doesn't support MCP sampling. See [MCP Setup Guide](docs/MCP_SETUP.md) for details and current status.

Once Claude Desktop adds sampling support, you'll be able to use Context Foundry directly:

```
Use context_foundry_build to create a REST API with:
- FastAPI framework
- PostgreSQL database
- JWT authentication
- OpenAPI documentation
Call it "my-api"
```

**Benefits (when available):**
- ✅ Uses Claude Pro/Max subscription (no additional per-token charges)
- ✅ Interactive - review and modify plans before building
- ✅ Seamless Claude Desktop integration

**For now:** Use API mode below.

#### Option 2: API Mode (standalone CLI)

**1. Build New Projects (from scratch)**

```bash
# Interactive build with reviews
foundry build my-app "Build user authentication with JWT"
# Creates project in: examples/my-app/

# Autonomous build (no reviews)
foundry build api-server "REST API with PostgreSQL" --autonomous

# Overnight session (8 hours)
foundry build big-project "Complex system" --overnight 8

# With livestream dashboard
foundry build web-app "Todo app" --livestream
```

**Note:** Projects are created in the `examples/` directory to keep generated code organized and separate from the Context Foundry codebase.

**2. Enhance Existing Projects (modify existing code)** 🚧 *Coming Soon*

```bash
# Navigate to your existing repo
cd ~/my-existing-project

# Enhance with new features
foundry enhance "Add JWT authentication to existing API"

# This will:
# - Scout your existing codebase
# - Plan changes that fit your architecture
# - Make targeted modifications
# - Create a PR for review
```

**When to use which:**
- `foundry build` - Starting a new project from scratch
- `foundry enhance` - Adding features to an existing codebase

### Monitor Progress

```bash
# Check current session
foundry status

# Watch mode (live updates)
foundry status --watch

# Analyze completed session
foundry analyze --format markdown --save report.md
```

## Key Principles

- **Specs are permanent, code is disposable**
- **Context quality > model capability**
- **Human review at maximum leverage (planning)**
- **40% context utilization is the golden zone**
- **Tests before implementation, always**

- **BAML Fix**: 300K line Rust codebase, PR merged in 1 hour
- **Boundary**: 35K lines with WASM support in 7 hours
- **AgentCoder**: 96.3% pass@1 on HumanEval

### Performance Metrics (from real usage)

- **Context Efficiency**: Maintains <40% utilization on 200K token windows
- **Completion Rate**: 85-95% of planned tasks completed autonomously
- **Code Quality**: 90%+ test coverage on generated code
- **Speed**: 3-10x faster than traditional development
- **Token Efficiency**: 60-70% reduction via smart compaction
- **Pattern Reuse**: 40% improvement on repeated task types

## The Anti-Vibe Philosophy

### Traditional "vibe coding" with AI:

❌ Endless back-and-forth shouting at the AI
❌ Context bloat from accumulated confusion
❌ 20,000 line PRs nobody can review
❌ Prompts thrown away after code generation

### Context Foundry approach:

✅ Systematic three-phase progression
✅ Context maintained under 40% always
✅ Small, reviewable, tested changes
✅ Specs and plans as permanent artifacts

## Advanced Features

- **Pattern Library**: Learns from successful implementations
- **Context Compaction**: Automatic summarization at 50% usage (based on [Claude agent SDK patterns](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-agents-with-the-claude-agent-sdk))
- **Subagent Isolation**: 200K token windows returning 1-2K summaries
- **Test-First Development**: Tests generated before implementation
- **Continuous Checkpointing**: Git commits after each task
