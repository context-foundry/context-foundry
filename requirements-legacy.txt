# ⚠️ LEGACY: Context Foundry v1.x Python CLI Dependencies
#
# This file contains dependencies for the deprecated v1.x Python CLI.
# Most users DO NOT need this file!
#
# For v2.x MCP Server (recommended): Use requirements-mcp.txt instead
# For v2.x MCP Server (minimal):     Only ~50MB of dependencies
#
# This legacy file includes ~3-4GB of ML libraries (PyTorch, CUDA, sentence-transformers)
# that were planned for a "Pattern Library" feature that was never completed.
#
# Only install this if you specifically need the old v1.x CLI (not recommended).
# Last updated: October 2025
