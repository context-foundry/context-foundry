**🧠 Self-Learning Release:** Context Foundry now learns from every build and continuously improves itself.

### 🚀 Added

#### Phase 7: Feedback Analysis

- **Automatic Feedback Collection**
  - Runs after every build (success or failure)
  - Analyzes test iterations, failures, and fixes
  - Extracts patterns and learnings automatically
  - Generates structured feedback files: `.context-foundry/feedback/build-feedback-{timestamp}.json`
  - Creates actionable recommendations for each phase

- **Pattern Library System** (`.context-foundry/patterns/`)
  - **common-issues.json** - General issues with proven solutions across all project types
  - **test-patterns.json** - Testing strategy improvements and coverage gaps
  - **architecture-patterns.json** - Proven design patterns from successful builds
  - **scout-learnings.json** - Risk detection patterns and research insights
  - Auto-apply mechanism for proven patterns (frequency >= 3)
  - Pattern matching by project type for relevant application
  - Frequency tracking to identify common vs rare issues

#### Enhanced Phases with Self-Learning

- **Scout (Phase 1)**
  - Reads past learnings before starting research
  - Flags known risks from pattern library
  - Warns about common issues for detected project types
  - Example: Automatically flags CORS risk for browser apps with ES6 modules

- **Architect (Phase 2)**
  - Applies proven architectural patterns automatically
  - Includes preventive measures for known issues
  - Adds dependencies/configurations that prevent common failures
  - Example: Auto-includes http-server for browser apps with ES6 modules

- **Test (Phase 4)**
  - Checks for known issues before running tests
  - Runs pattern-based integration tests
  - Validates against project-type-specific requirements
  - Example: Verifies dev server configuration for browser apps

#### Initial Patterns (Seeded from 1942 Clone Build)

- **cors-es6-modules** - CORS error with ES6 modules from file://
  - Root cause: Browsers block module imports from file:// protocol
  - Solution: Include http-server in package.json from the start
  - Auto-apply: TRUE for browser apps with ES6 modules

- **unit-tests-miss-browser-issues** - Unit tests don't catch browser integration issues
  - Gap: Jest+jsdom mocks browser but doesn't catch CORS/module loading
  - Solution: Add browser integration tests with Playwright/Selenium
  - Auto-apply: TRUE for browser/web apps

- **entity-component-game-architecture** - Proven game architecture pattern
  - Structure: Entity base classes + manager systems
  - Benefits: Clean separation, 100% testable, easy to extend
  - Success rate: 100%

- **browser-es6-modules-risk-detection** - Scout risk detection pattern
  - Trigger: Project mentions browser/web AND uses ES6 modules
  - Action: Flag CORS risk in scout-report.md
  - Result: Issue prevented before it occurs
