# Scout Report: BAML + Anthropic Agent Skills Integration

## Executive Summary

Building a production-ready integration example showcasing **BAML (BoundaryML's type-safe prompting framework)** with **Anthropic's Agent Skills system** as a feature within Context Foundry. This will demonstrate how to combine BAML's compile-time type safety with Anthropic's progressive skill disclosure for building intelligent agents.

**Project Type**: Integration example / SDK integration / Developer tooling
**Primary Languages**: Python, TypeScript
**Target Users**: Developers building AI agents with type-safe prompts

## Key Requirements Analysis

### 1. Technology Stack Decision

**BAML Framework**:
- Latest version: 0.75.0+ (as of Jan 2025)
- Type-safe prompt engineering with compile-time validation
- Generates client code for Python and TypeScript
- VSCode extension available for .baml file editing
- **Justification**: Industry-leading prompt framework with strong type safety guarantees

**Anthropic Integration**:
- Anthropic Python SDK (anthropic>=0.40.0)
- Anthropic TypeScript SDK (@anthropic-ai/sdk)
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet or later (supports Agent Skills)
- Agent Skills: Progressive disclosure pattern for complex capabilities
- **Justification**: Agent Skills provide production-ready skill management

**Development Environment**:
- Python 3.10+ (BAML requires modern Python)
- Node.js 18+ (for TypeScript examples)
- BAML CLI for code generation
- Poetry or pip for Python dependency management
- npm/pnpm for TypeScript dependencies

### 2. Critical Architecture Recommendations

**A. BAML Configuration Structure** (PRIORITY: HIGH):
```
baml_src/
├── clients.baml       # Anthropic client with skill_id parameter
├── functions.baml     # Type-safe function definitions
└── types.baml         # Custom types for structured outputs
```

**B. Example Categories** (3 required):
1. **Document Processing**: PDF/DOCX skills with structured extraction
2. **Data Analysis**: Dataset processing with progressive disclosure
3. **Custom Skill**: Demonstrate skill definition and loading patterns

**C. Dual Implementation** (PRIORITY: CRITICAL):
- Full Python implementation with async/await
- Complete TypeScript implementation with proper typing
- Both must be production-ready (error handling, streaming, logging)

**D. Integration with Context Foundry**:
- Location: `/integrations/baml/` (NOT separate repo)
- Update main Context Foundry README
- Standalone but integrated documentation

### 3. Known Risks & Mitigations

**Risk 1: BAML Client Configuration Complexity**
- **Issue**: skill_id parameter passthrough may require custom client config
- **Mitigation**: Research BAML's custom parameter syntax, use client_options if needed
- **Pattern ID**: None (new integration)
- **Severity**: MEDIUM

**Risk 2: Agent Skills Progressive Disclosure**
- **Issue**: Skills should only be introduced when task requires them
- **Mitigation**: Design examples that demonstrate conditional skill loading
- **Reference**: Anthropic blog post on Agent Skills architecture
- **Severity**: MEDIUM

**Risk 3: Type Safety Validation**
- **Issue**: Ensuring BAML types match Anthropic skill inputs/outputs
- **Mitigation**: Create comprehensive tests that validate type flow
- **Severity**: HIGH

**Risk 4: API Key Management**
- **Issue**: Examples need API keys but must not commit them
- **Mitigation**: Use .env files, provide .env.template, clear setup docs
- **Pattern ID**: Standard security practice
- **Severity**: HIGH

**Risk 5: Testing Without API Calls**
- **Issue**: Tests should work without consuming API credits
- **Mitigation**: Include mock tests alongside integration tests
- **Severity**: MEDIUM

### 4. Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests**:
- BAML function validation (type checking)
- Mock API responses for quick testing
- Python: pytest with async support
- TypeScript: Vitest or Jest

**Integration Tests**:
- Real API calls with Anthropic (optional, gated by API key)
- Skill invocation lifecycle
- Error handling for skill failures
- Streaming response handling

**E2E Tests** (CRITICAL per pattern library):
- ⚠️ **Pattern ID: e2e-testing-spa-real-browser** (Severity: CRITICAL)
- While this is not a SPA, similar principle applies: test in target environment
- For API integration: Test actual API calls, not just mocks
- Verify BAML generated code compiles and runs
- **Justification**: Past builds showed passing unit tests ≠ working integration

**Test Data**:
- Sample PDF documents for document processing example
- Sample CSV for data analysis example
- Mock skill responses for offline testing

### 5. Main Challenges & Mitigations

**Challenge 1: BAML + Anthropic SDK Integration**
- **What**: Passing skill_id through BAML's client abstraction
- **How**: Use BAML's client_options or custom parameters
- **Mitigation**: Research BAML docs, examine examples, test early

**Challenge 2: Progressive Disclosure Pattern**
- **What**: Skills should be loaded conditionally based on task
- **How**: Design examples showing skill discovery and selection
- **Mitigation**: Follow Anthropic's engineering blog best practices

**Challenge 3: Dual Language Parity**
- **What**: Python and TypeScript examples must have feature parity
- **How**: Build both simultaneously, ensure identical capabilities
- **Mitigation**: Create checklist of features, verify both implementations

**Challenge 4: Documentation Depth**
- **What**: Comprehensive docs for setup, examples, and best practices
- **How**: Create 4 docs: README, SETUP, EXAMPLES, BEST_PRACTICES
- **Mitigation**: Use templates, include code samples, troubleshooting

### 6. Timeline Estimate

**Total Estimated Duration**: 4-6 hours (autonomous build time)

- Scout: 30 minutes (this report)
- Architect: 45 minutes (detailed design)
- Builder: 2-3 hours (dual implementation)
- Test: 1-2 hours (including self-healing iterations)
- Documentation: 45 minutes
- Deploy: 15 minutes

### 7. Success Criteria Validation

✅ **Technical Requirements**:
- BAML configuration works with Anthropic API
- All 3 example functions work end-to-end
- Both Python and TypeScript implementations complete
- Comprehensive documentation (4+ files)
- Error handling and streaming functional
- Progressive disclosure demonstrated
- Tests pass (unit + integration)

✅ **Quality Requirements**:
- Production-ready code quality
- Security best practices (no API keys committed)
- Clear comments at integration points
- Easy for developers to get started (<5 minutes)

✅ **Integration Requirements**:
- Properly integrated into Context Foundry structure
- Main README updated with reference
- Works alongside existing Context Foundry features

## Relevant Past Learnings

No directly matching patterns from past builds (this is a novel integration type). However, general patterns apply:

- ✅ **Pattern: python-missing-setup-py** - Include both pyproject.toml AND setup.py
- ✅ **Pattern: e2e-testing-spa-real-browser** - Test in target environment (real API calls)
- ✅ **Pattern: missing-library-cdn** - Verify all dependencies are actually loaded
- ⚠️ **Pattern: typescript-express-types-tsnode** - Proper TypeScript type setup critical

## Next Steps

Proceed to **Phase 2 (Architect)** to create detailed system architecture including:
- Complete file structure for both Python and TypeScript
- BAML function definitions with type specifications
- Client configuration patterns
- API integration architecture
- Testing infrastructure design
- Documentation structure
